science,"Why don't you bother instead and respond properly from your high tower of wisdom? So, one article overrules the consensus on Wikipedia that glutamate is excitotoxic? What about the other studies I posted? Are they successfully ""debunked"" by that article as well?
Btw, I did read the article and happen to work on rodent models of neurotoxocity caused by glutamate, histidine, aspartate, cysteine, and methionine. True, rats and mice are not humans but if you see what these amino acids (and especially chronic exposure to low levels of dietary glutamate) cause to rodent brains you wouldn't be so quick to downvote (if you did in fact)."
iama,"AAIA's ACES is the database standard (http://www.aftermarket.org/Technology/ACES.aspx) that provides us with the vehicle attributes, parts classifications and qualifier statements. It's our responsibility to add the products and include the correct attributes to make it searchable through faceted navigation. 

Sometimes the vendors provide us with their products ACES data, but often it contains errors so we have to create our own applications. Over 90% of our 120,000 SKU's we have created the applications ourselves.

iama,"So many.  I needed to perform a maintenance run on a 737 engine that just had a MEC (Main Engine Control) replacement.  The preservative in the MEC was not thoroughly introduced into the fuel for the engine.  The preservative used in the MEC is extremely volatile even more so than the Jet A fuel the CFM engine uses.  When I raised the start lever my fuel flow ran away and before I could shut it off it shot about a 60 foot flame out the exhaust of the engine.  It was night out and caused the ramp to light up.  Not a major concern but it scared the S**T out of the newbies standing by on the ground.  I swear I could see from the flight deck their eyes get as big as basketballs.  A veteran mechanic came over the intercom and asked ""That was great.  Can you do it again?"""
worldnews,"Ukraine used to be part of Russia in the Soviet Union era.  It is now its own country, and it wants to be part of the European Union.  There is a minority in Ukraine that want to return to Russia.

A few months ago, Russia stepped in and said ""We're taking the peninsula of Crimea"", an important part of Ukraine.  Then a bunch of people in Eastern Ukraine (who may or may not be Russian army in disguise) formed a militia and declared their intention to separate from Ukraine and return East Ukraine to Russia.

So the Separatists are either discontents in Ukraine who want to return to Russia, or imported Russian insurgents screwing with Ukraine.  Either way, they're sparking a war.  It's a war that Ukraine cannot win unless they convince Europe and the US to help them fight Russia, which means this could blow up into a BIG war."

The reason why it was 11 minutes is because that moment had been proceeded by years of arguing about the problem. It was a formality in that moment, but getting there it could have as easily had happened that the US backed the Palestinian cause.  They chose not to mostly due to short term Cold War politics."
iama,"I'd love to chime in on this one.  I'm frequently asked to speak or write about transgenic crop technology.  I give an evidence-based description of the strengths and limitations of the technology.  As we know, the benefits by far outweigh limitations, so my discussion is always positive toward the technology.  However, out of respect for ""balance"" journalists etc  invite people with political motivations that have no grounding in science.  This is considered fair?  There are not two sides to the science here.  There is the published, reproducible science and there are websites.  The big loser in false balance is the perception of science.  It is like having to invite Ken Hamm any time you discuss evolution, or Rush Limbaugh every time we discuss climate.  Last week I was paired with a woman that just reiterated the same inflammatory nonsense.  It came off as credible because she shared the venue with someone that knew the science. "
science,"I think music and mathematics have some similarities. But as a graphic designer and someone who dabbles in art. Math is above and beyond my worst subject. 

With regards to music there's two types of musical artists, and sometimes they cross paths.

Paul MccArtney on the other hand wasn't a very technical guitarist, but wrote amazing songs. I thing my favorite musicians share qualities of both."

worldnews,"I can translate perfect Spanish however there is a slight variance to the way he spells. He is also all over the place on his tweets but here it is.

Downed plane by missile

Military radar could pick up missile not civilian radar.

Military from the ministry knew everything as it was happening

They took military control of tower control

When they took over our tower we knew it was them(Ukraine)

The faces of the military gave them away and later forces that arrived spoke openly about it

They asked us to say their version of the story

Our response was that our radars do not pick up missiles

Them saying they don't know where the missile came from is a lie.

However, it is not true that once a settlement is built somewhere, it will remain Israeli forever (i.e. the pizza analogy). After all a settlement is just a series of buildings which anyone can live in, and changing the sovereignty over that settlement is as easy as lowering one flag and raising another.

I don't think Israel should be building these settlements but the claim that they are ""gobbling up Palestinian land"" doesn't jive with the facts."
science,"It depends a lot on the field. In many science fields, the normal provides no service around typesetting and very little in the way of editing. You do the typesetting work yourself, using a LaTeX class that was probably developed 20 years ago by a volunteer. All reviewing is done by volunteers. The editor is generally a professor as well, and while the journal may provide some nominal support, it's pretty limited. The only thing I've ever personally seen come from the paid staff rather than volunteers are things like reminder emails to submit my camera ready copy by a certain date.

In fields where authors are less tech savvy, this may be quite different. But in computer science at least, you can create an online open access journal in a few hours of work, and administering it isn't particularly hard either, at least compared to what you'd expect based on what publishers charge."

worldnews,"Gases mix so it would make no difference.  Example: You are not treading through pools of CO2 and bromine when you walk around outside even though they are 'heavier' than Nitrogen and Oxygen.  There is also Hydrogen and Helium in the air around you.  Gases don't stratify much at all if they are at the same temperature.

Gases that 'collect' in basements like Radon are actually created in those basements by the rocks.  It is merely lack of ventilation that allows the concentration to increase because it can't escape.

According to the law of biogenesis, no living thing can change kind. Once a dog, always a dog. Once a cat, always a cat. Once a monkey, always a monkey. Once a human, always a human etc,. Now since this is an established fact and law of science which the current model of evolutionary theory contradicts, are you going to make this aware to young people so they can not be brain washed with pseudoscience which has no actual existing evidence in support of it?"
science,"No chance. To develop as a male an embryo needs a gene called SRY and that is present only on the Y chromosome.
In such a case, both women will transmit an X chromosome to the offspring that will therefore be XX, hence a girl.
Sometimes genes can move from one chromosome to an other but this wouldn't be relevant here as women do not carry the SRY gene.
The only scenario I see is that the SOX3 genes which gave rise to the SRY gene mutates and give rise to a de novo SRY gene. But this is unlikely as these genes are now highly diverged (the diverged ~ 200 million years ago), this will imply that many specific mutations occur on the same gene. "

If that is trying to win against a prosecutor by providing an all out defense for a horrible criminal, a psychopath can keep the criminal justice system fair.

iama,"Drunk agronomist here. Where I am the most expensive single pesticide is roughly $75 per acre. 120 acres per a field, means $9,000 per field. however, if plant health was indicative of pest population, some places apply up to 5 insecticides per season, which means to spot treat could save you easily 36000 assuming you only spray 20% of the field. For yield, in a decent year crops can fetch $5,000 per acre. Again, at 120 acres per field, that can run up to a max of $600,000 per field. This means a % yield increase of 12% per field due to chemical is $50,000 in yields.  And that just a 120 acre field! If he's farming 8,000 acres, then we're talking about 66 times these numbers!

science,"I think talking about ""adoptions"" is plain wrong. It implies species somehow adopt to the ecosystem, which actually has very creationalistic feel to it.

The reality is much more brutal: evolution is a random process caused by mistakes in copies of genetic material. Only individuals who are successful in mating pass those mistakes further on. 

A mistake could cause bizarre anomalies, like dogs growing horns. But if such dog mated, it means the anomaly is successful in the given environment. The offsprings could potentially grow horns as well.

Imagine if spotify had a bad protocol and the songs you listened too could potentially just slightly change when you listen to it. If you then shared it further, more of your friends would have the copy with the error, and eventually that could be the song favorable by everyone. That's evolution."

Let's see. 730-8200. Adds to 10 on both sides, using the same amount of numbers, then places zeros. Larger numbers first in both cases. Very nice.

632-8426, nice bookends with the 6's, 3x2 = 6, 4x2 = 8, then 4+2 = 6.

Partly it's devices to memorize numbers. Can't always rely on them having a nice ring to them when said aloud. Most aren't perfect, but many are pretty."

Now that you know most people who get divorced are less than 25 years of age do you really think ""game over"" is the reason, or would you be willing to entertain the idea that those getting married don't know what they are doing and are instead getting married too soon.

worldnews,"&gt;It's the Christian day of worship -- Sunday

This is not correct. Sabbath is the Jewish day of worship: from Friday evening to Saturday afternoon. That was why I assumed you were Jewish.

&gt;The Germans generally don't see these restrictions as religious in nature but rather cultural. But to me, being neither Christian nor German, the obvious Christian cultural influence made it seem like overt religious oppression.

I fail to see the link between this restriction and religious oppression. The law is not concerning a religious observance, but a civil one. Now, if it made an exception for any member of the German Evangelical Church, that would be a different matter."
todayilearned,"It could affect his views on contextual appropriateness, though. As someone who respected the great thing that is language, it could make sense that he viewed Latin not as objectively better, but only that in the particular context, observation of traditional methodology would be a superior choice.

On the other hand, there's perfectly good reasons to believe otherwise, including that this is a behavior typical of humans in general, who mostly happen to be non-linguists. For example, few citizens of the US would want the constitution to be written in a different language. For one, every idea could be expressed just as effectively, and we also have no official language. But it was written in English and politics/intellectual matters have always been handled in English in the US. It's just tradition."

science,"the myers brigg test while it has some standing as an empirical test of personality its only based off the best we can do, meaning we still don't really have a concrete idea of these things let alone a way to test personalities definitively. Similar to the IQ test which was created only to tell if you were developmentally challenged, it only tests your ability at one thing which is to succeed at school related environments. For example the 2nd time you take the myers briggs test something good happened that day and your feeling more confident in yourself and other things than you were the last time you took it, you might score as and extrovert instead of introvert or maybe you're feeling hopeful in trusting in yourself and you score as more intuitive than judgmental. The test was never created as a concrete idea but just to hopefully gain a relative base to work from on your natural behavior "

It's better to have as many people as possible in research roles for that chance of more breakthroughs (something that has been reversing in recent years in many countries).

But the thing is, we would hit a natural resources bottleneck (which is actually a lot further off than some people think), and likely we won't hit that due to population but will have to change the way we do a lot of things such as agruculture to avoid changing the climate too much - but that won't happen because the people in control know their decendents will be powerful enough to live good lives by continuing the current resource exploitation."

science,"The article says men are 25% more likely to be overweight and says this debunks the notion that women let themselves go after marriage (which it doesnt unless anyone was claiming only women do this). The only way to know to what we are really talking about is to know by what extent men and women become overweight after marriage.  What were their starting weights and what were their weights X years into the marriage? This is important. It could also be that men put on more weight after marriage on average, but women are still more overweight, and they can still say the same thing.
 
And ""overweight"" is not necessarily ""obese"" and even if men and women both got ""obese"" then it would still be relevant to what degree.

science,"GT: 
Hi - here's my two cents worth.

I think biology is now moving to a situation where data analysis is becoming much more important (although traditional lab techniques will still be with us for a long time to come). 

The amount of biological data being generated is increasing dramatically. So for example,  genomic approaches like RNAseq (see www.fightingEBV.org for info) are becoming widespread. But even things like flow cytometry are now beginning to be capable of analysing 50 variables on the same cell. Remarkable opportunities but the analysis is going to start becoming the rate limiting step soon, IMO. 



So, understanding the underpinning  biology is clearly important - but I think being able also to be able to analyse large data sets would open a lot of doors. 

Hope this helps - just my opinion!  Biology is undergoing a revolution right now - very exciting times to be in the field. Good luck!"

As this article illustrates, they're afraid of saying the perpetrators, teh gangsters responsible for these sexual crimes against chilren, are Muslim Pakistanis.

science,"&gt;When our immune system fights an infection, the dying virus releases toxins into the bloodstream that can cause sepsis, a life-threatening immune response. 

That is the not true-est thing I've read all day. Bacteria release inflammatory factors, mostly from their membranes, when they are killed by immune cells. Viruses do not release inflammatory factors when they are cleared from the blood stream through phagocytosis by primary immune cells. However, the cells that become apoptotic due to infection by viruses do release molecules that can lead to an inflammatory cascade."

The ""white man's burden"" is idea that white people have a duty to rule over non-whites to have things run efficiently. Basically the idea that non-whites weren't intelligent enough to handle organizing society without whites in running the show, so it was the ""burden"" of whites to handle it.

The riots in Ferguson only fall under the concept of the ""white man's burden"" if they are being organized and designed up white's because of the premise that whites are the only ones smart enough to do so.

I'm not there, but I'd be interested in the evidence to back the claim up.

science,"I saw an article recently stating that there was a link between angiotensin converting enzymes and Alzheimer's. It said that ACE was partially responsible for the break down of the protein fibers and plaques that form in Alzheimer's. To your knowledge, is there any truth to this and if so, is there a correlation between the prevalence of Alzheimer's and the use of ACE inhibitors in the last few decades?

Thank you for the work that you do! I am glad there are much smarter people than I working on research for these cognitive issues.

science,"The three modes of learning, according to a well-regarded model are visual, auditory, and tactual-kinesthetic (physical movement). http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Through-Modality-Strengths-Practices/dp/0883091003 
 We all learn through some proportional variant of these styles, along with probably myriads of other factors.  Listening to a lecture, writing in longhand, and seeing the words on the page is a mixture of all three modes.  For those who lean towards the kinesthetic mode, the physical act of handwriting can be a valuable learning stimulus.  For someone who is more auditory, it might be a distraction.  And for someone who is more visual, perhaps the ordered lines of notes on a laptop screen would be preferred.  However, longhand seems to be an optimal combination of the three for most people.  Many authors only write in longhand for their first drafts.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles"

They have hormones like abscisic acid (ABA) which ""informs them"" the ability to drop leaves and such.  Some hormones are regulated in the plant by the presence or absense of sunlight.

science,"While I agree corn ethanol is an inefficient method of production, that's not to say ethanol is inefficient.  Sugar beets and sugar cane can be used instead of corn, and are much less inefficient, and can offer cost reductions in fuel.

While it is true that ethanol has lower heat content, it also has higher octane than gasoline.  If auto mfg.s wanted to take advantage of this, cars could be made with equivalent mpgs and as clean as, if not cleaner, emissions.  This would require either dedicated engines for ethanol, or engines with variable boost systems, neither of which are in existence. "
iama,"I wasn't on Kitchen Nightmares but was on his show ""The F Word"" about 10 years ago (UK). Thought I'd share my memories of him.

It was the 10 minute part of the show where he would go to someone's house and teach them how to cook because they were so bad at it. My mum applied because I kept asking her to stop the ready meals and try and cook more homemade meals. She got in! He was filming at our house for a day. He was such a lovely man, VERY TALL, and made everyone laugh and feel super comfortable. When he had finished teaching my mum how to make Paella, we all sat down (invited some friends to ours to join) with Gordon and enjoyed the meal. Such a great experience! They ended up insisting on buying a big dining table because ours was too small for the people we had invited (they wanted a specific number of people to eat with us, we weren't being greedy, haha) so they let us keep that and gave us a camcorder.

The size of bombs you can get on a plane is pretty limited, and most of the crashes caused by as such may blow a hole in the side of the plane and bring down the aircraft by severing hydro lines and flight control lines.

There are great big pieces of the plane lying around, meaning it broke up mid-flight. When an anti-aircraft missile attacks a target, it detonates away from the aircraft and shoots giant metal rods at the aircraft, usually severing great big pieces off of it.

By no means does this excuse any abuse they perpetrated, nor does it excuse them for not reporting abuse they witnessed.

You're never quite sure who's alive and who's dead in those movies and it's kind of the point.

The first thing I got was a bunch of strengtheners because they were so soft and thin. It didn't quite do the trick though and I went to a salon for fake nails. They're a bit thicker than natural nails and is extremely uncomfortable to bite into. This gave them the rest they needed and I applied strengtheners almost daily. When the nails eventually came off I made a habit of taking care of them and painting them in funny colors and stuff. It's my new hobby and I love doing it. It's as therapeutic as biting now. 

TL: DR: fake nails. Paint them. If they're pretty you're less likely to bite them. "

We implore our prime minister and cabinet, as well as our German neighbours and friends to reject further Russian aggression against our union.

The Ukraine is not a NATO or EU member, however this attack against the citizens of the Netherlands, Malaysia, and other deserves the toughest of responses.

All relations should be terminated, Russia should be isolated as well as any nation which stands at their side.

The standards are very clear and detailed, the menu items are regular in the basics, but most have a little Taco Bell twist on them.  As a company, there's also a lot of opportunity for anyone that works there.  One of my coworkers who I became great friends with started when she was 16 and at 28, she's the RGM now.  Moving up isn't hard and 35 grand a year just to make tacos isn't bad."

If you think the system sucks, the only way to reform it is to get involved at this point instead of posting comments straight out of /r/im14andthisisdeep.

A lot of the times i feel like it's presented as a subversive activety and skaters are often represented as rockstars/pissdrunks/etc. by the mags, but your presence added a 'no, some people just like to skate' response to this which more than likely contributed to skateboarding's growing legitimacy that we see now.  As a result a lot of parks got made, which is nice.

I will definitely be more active although I'm focusing on social involvement more than political, as much as you can sensibly separate the two.

I've been mostly aware and intellectually/emotionally invested in the overall problem of seemingly excessive violence between police and people of color (and sometimes people in general) with most of the costs of that situation in terms of life and quality of life being born by black and latino communities.

science,"&gt;they dont have to be foolproof to be useful as exclusionary criteria though.

If they (the ""trap"" questions, specifically) are so easily beatable, they're not really criteria at all. It's pretty obvious that anyone with a bit of knowledge can cheat a psych evaluation; they're only reliable because most people don't intentionally deceive them. The reliability of psych tests is completely based on the honor system and the patients' desire to be truthful. Therefore telling people that there are trap questions (even if there aren't, or they don't work) helps because it encourages people to be honest, NOT because they can actually detect liars.

No test is completely foolproof, true, but it's much harder to fake, say, a blood test or a biopsy without actually injuring yourself."

worldnews,"Of course, but do you disagree it would make you feel second class or even subhuman if for some reason it was forbidden for you to show your face, let alone only the eyes in public? You can shed it at home, but once you step out the door, your gender suddenly makes your body shameful. You cannot have eye to eye conversation with another person, exchange smiles, or generally enjoy human interaction that is so dependent on facial expression. You're just a bag of cloth that talks, if it's with another woman. If it were a man, it's a silent bag of cloth, but it is really a human you covered up and censored.

I don't usually correct anyone unless they're so far off that they're ordering something that isn't in that building."

science,"GMOs have the potential to benefit the environment. Here are some reasons why:

- improved productivity means less land being used for cultivation
- GM crops resistant to pests would require less pesticides
- they could rehabilitate damaged land
- a GM crop modified so that it lasts longer may reduce general waste
- GM crops could be bred specifically for energy (biofuel)

There are definitely concerns for the environment and the science isn't clear cut.. but there are also environmental concerns relating to the use of traditional crops and the organic industry.. I should also add the organic industry is a multi billion dollar industry (overall a larger industry than Monsanto)."

further; retail and restaurant managers do whatever they can to make needy customers happy [whether they're in the right or not].  but in the moment, it's really just for peace.  because no one likes complaining.  not because they owe the customer freebies.

And remember that delusional behavior is not necessarily psychotic behavior. A BP patient in acute mania can believe that they are a highly tuned sexual machine who lures everyone, but in reality they haven't showered in a week and look like shit. "

I don't see a problem with putting this kind of stuff online where people can actively search it out, or at least choose whether or not to open it after being warned. But putting it on live television, where people who knew those on the flight are probably watching for updates? That's not cool to me. "

Then you have even more leads! And then it's a matter of looking at even more papers and getting in touch with the professors personally... I find a lot of the time recent publications don't necessarily reflect the current research in the lab and even if their work you've heard about sounds great you may end up working on a completely different (albeit related) project.

iama,"That second paragraph is horrible.  My point was the first paragraph on modern usage.

Mainly, unless you're specifically engaged in a debate, pointing out the ""incorrect"" usage of ""begging the question"" is a pedantic dick move.  Grammatically, it actually works as synonymous with ""raising the question"".  It gets the point across, it's not misspelled, and is the common vernacular.

It's not like someone saying ""I could care less"" which actually means the opposite of what they mean grammatically.

Anyone who fails to recognize the modern usage of ""begging the question"" had better cease using any modern phrasing.

EDITED TO ADD: I hope everyone who corrects someone on this also corrects people if they use the term ""terrific"" to mean anything other than ""causing terror"", and ""awful"" to mean anything other than ""inspiring awe""."
worldnews,"&gt; This means that the rich aren't contributing as much as they should.

This is an entirely subjective matter and is in fact the entire discussion we are having. Many people would disagree with the truthfulness of this statement. I do not see the logic which you have used to reach this conclusion based only on the preposition that the gap between rich and poor is growing.

Whilst you are trying to avoid saying it directly, it seems that you are now accepting that a billionaire who pays roughly 100,000 times more tax as a secretary is not consuming anywhere near 100,000 times as much in public services."

However, the day it came out I got grounded for god knows what. My mother was exceptionally cruel and made it so that I was not allowed to watch or look at the television at all but I could be in the same room and listen to my siblings play it all day. My mother and my siblings taunted me, almost describing what it was like and then laughing at my pain. I had to imagine what the game was like for about two days before I could play it. One of the worst moments in my life, but one of the best damn games ever that encouraged me to get good at skating. "
todayilearned,"This is nonsense. Apple's A7 processor is designed by Apple's own processor design team. This is why Apple have a phone with a 64 bit processor when nobody else does, because they designed it.

Samsung may manufacture the processor for Apple but they can't put it in their own phones or sell it to anyone else because it is Apple's.

If Samsung want a 64 processor for their phones then they are going to have to wait for usual suspects like Qualcomm make one that they are allowed to use.

Apple could (in theory) get any chip fab to manufacture their processor designs but they use Samsung because of the volume required and because they have a massive deal with Samsung for supplying all kinds of electronic components."

African-Americans need opportunity more because they're discriminated against and it needs to be evened out.

More blacks are in prison because of racism - and it's pretty easy to confirm this by comparing the crime rates of different races to their incarceration rates - the black crime rate is a bit higher, while their incarceration rate is *way* higher.

iama,"No. Not ""*as bad*"". That change is much bigger than many give it credit for. This voice change is Lucas tying the prequels to the originals, but it doesn't alter the story. Greedo shooting first change does. 

Because Han shooting first tells you, without spoonfed exposition, that he is not a black and white good character. He is floating the fence with the dark and light side. He is openly willing to kill at this part of his journey to save his neck. Then come EpVI he is willing to die for a cause bigger than him. That is his story arc throughout the series. And once you make him simply *defending* himself against Greedo instead of outright murdering him then you've flattened that arc. "
science,"No. Math has everything to do with our brains. It's the result of our pattern finding instinct. You won't find arithmetics anywhere else. The fact that the universe can be ""accurately"" modeled with mathematics is the result of the fact that the universe is consistent over time. About the accuracy, so far, all physics is either an approximate average of a very complex system (most things on our scale), completely unpredictable (things on the quantum scale) or disconnected from all things we modeled before (relativistic sizes and speeds). If the universe is governed by mathematics, you'd think we would have found some unity right now."

You, as a coach and a player have to know that every call isn't going to go your way. But you also have to know that yelling at a non-professional referee isn't going to get you anywhere. It's going to do more harm than good.

Despite you clearly being in a hurry and late for your flight, you still took a few minutes to chat with 10 year-old me and my 13 year-old brother. That was super nice of you and all these years later, I still remember it very fondly. Thank you! You're a good dude.

science,"Narcissism is the pursuit of gratification from vanity, or egotistic admiration of one's own physical or mental attributes, that derive from arrogant pride

when your taking pictures of yourself, every day.. it becomes egotistical to admire your own physical self. 

The issue here, is that we are ignoring a new age and the new generation of norms. This is comparable to the homosexuals in the 1700's when they were treating it like a disease because it went against social norms.

previously generations didnt have all these camera, video equipment, social media sites to share ourselves to the world. If ""selfies"" stick around for the next 2 decades and if selfies remain common for that peroid of time. it will be the new norm. This will not remove the label of narcissism, but will force us to think twice prior to labeling someone. 

Because if the norm is to take pictures of your self and post them on facebook, then the narcissist will have to be 3 standard deviations more than that.

iama,"Good question, that's something that lawyers ask a lot. 

The answer is ""sort of."" I do not make the decision to pay or deny a claim, that's the adjuster's decision. Sometimes I miss being able to do that.

What I do is present the adjuster with my findings - we often do a teleconference and/or I send my case report over. They decide what to do with the claim from there. Sometimes they need more info and ask me to follow up. 

If the claim is denied or reduced, I report the insured to law enforcement/state dept. of insurance, and the national insurance crime bureau. Then my case is closed."

Quite a while ago now (must be over ten years I think) my sister was bit by a rottweiler named Carl and, according to my parents, he ended up being your dog. Since then, I have told everyone and their mothers, very proudly, that my sis was bitten by Tony Hawk's dog (closest thing I had to being a celebrity when I was younger). I think you were doing a tour/documentary in Paris at the time so I didn't get to exploit the situation and meet you. I was wondering if you could confirm this to extinguish my childhood doubt.

Anyway, I heard from my parents that this may have lead to poor Carl being put down, so I hope this anecdote isn't re-opening an old wound. However, my family and I have since looked back on it fondly and, of course, with no ill will towards you or Carl (especially because he seemed to feel really bad after it happened).

How many drug related recovery tv shows are there that show the effect of drug use on friends and family? How many after school programs and in school programs focused on drug use and how it effects relationships? 


&gt;Shooting heroin by yourself, you can think you're just hurting yourself.

You can think (or claim to think) anything you like but that doesn't mean it's a rational thought. Any rational person is going to understand that their drug use effects others. The thing is they don't give a shit how their action effect others any more than the drunk driver gives a shit. "
science,"Yikes,  I mega remembered wrong. I guess the textbook I read was using probably just used the US as an example of high per capita emissions rather than saying we were the highest. 

Regardless I do kinda question How high all those middle Eastern countries are.

I wonder if the average person there is actually responsible for higher emissions or I'd the number is skewed by the production of oil. "
iama,"It's actually about the same in the Southern US, at least the part I live in.

It seems that Vader and Tarkin have this mutual respect where Tarkin respects Vader's powers and Vader knows Tarkin is good at his job and needs him.

todayilearned,"I do. And one of the reasons behind that is that people think it's not safe, so governments move away from it for fear of loosing votes. Take, for example, the recent-ish protests in the UK over nuclear power ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-15146781 ) where most protesters were saying that nuclear power isn't safe and that they didn't want a nuclear plant near where they live because of the radiation (not in the article, from memory of interviews).

All of this when you get exposed to more radiation by living next to a coal fire plant.

So, sure, it is like saying a Dodge is more fuel efficient than a Hummer. But it's like saying that in a world where everybody is saying that having a Dodge is going to burn all of your fuel and then kill you while it does it."
science,"Just from my own personal experience in several different jobs and industries over the years, I would not be surprised if this is true. There are definitely good managers out there who care about other people, but our current ultra-competitive, Darwinian win at all costs business environment creates an opportunity for people who have no empathy for anyone else and will do anything to get ahead with no qualms to succeed brilliantly to the point where they rise very high in the corporate hierarchy versus those who hesitate from stooping to the level necessary to get ahead. Then you end up with oppressive, short-sighted business practices that treat employees as little more than indentured servants in order to maximize the short-term gains of executives and high ranking managers. "
todayilearned,"I'm sure you've seen it before:

""Well, we need to give African-Americans more opportunity because they need it more."" - That's an example of basically saying blacks are incapable of taking care of themselves. 

More obvious examples can be ""well, there's more blacks in prison because the south is racist""


""Male rape isn't that common because men are less vulnerable than women"" - implying men should be able to defend themselves better so they shouldn't be raped in the first place

Practically anytime anyone mentions the word ""conservative"" the words redneck (which is offensive if you think about it) is applied.

iama,"It's not safety - it's because they are hot subs.  Before they had toasters, we would have to nuke the chicken and steak if someone ordered those subs.  The pain in the ass part is that if someone orders a steak sub and you *arent a good sandwich artist* and ask them if it is toasted up front, you waste 1-2 minutes waiting for the meat to heat.  If you throw it in at the beginning, it should ding once you cut the bread and put cheese on.  Most workers now seem to assume toasted, and that's why they sigh, but it's their fault."
askreddit,"I like to bake them to maximize moistness, caramel flavors, and a dense fudgey texture. Dissolving more sugar gives you caramel, brown sugar heavy sugar ratio adds moisture, melted hot butter and more egg yolks gives you denser and fudgier cookies, bread flour (or even wheat gluten) for chewier texture. I also prefer to just use chunks of good quality chocolate over chips. It's also the best if you eat them about 5-10 minutes out of the oven so that they are very warm but not so hot that it's unpleasant.

My girlfriend likes them almost completely different though (thin and crispy with semi sweet morsels) so it all comes down to preference.

Would you say, though, that the attitudes towards, say women, you observed in the East of Turkey are more representative of religious views, local tribal cultures or a mix?

science,"Yeah that's one of the debates I was reading about. They were discussing whether or not their brain can even process and comprehend theinformation and image.

Think of it like having a Blu-Ray player and a 720p HD TV. The source and equipment (The eye's rods and cones.) are recorded, designed, optimized and ready to play the image natively with all 2,073,600 pixels. 

But the TV (The brain.) is only capable of displaying 921,600 out of the 2+ million . The equipment and needs are all there to produce a high tech, super human image but none of that media can be viewed because the device used to view and process it can't keep up.

One example (forgive me for mistaking some details) would be that they patented a strain of corn. Yes, they have a patent on a living organism. 

In India and around the world, thousands of farmers have committed suicide because of Monsanto forcing farmers to buy their seeds. Here's why: let's say you have a farm and you don't use Monsanto's corn for whatever reason (mainly because it's more expensive). Your neighbor is using the patented Monsanto corn. Naturally, wind carries seeds from your neighbors crop to your farm, and some of the Monsanto corn grows on your farm. Monsanto now sues you for using their patented corn and you, a poor farmer, can't afford to be sued, will lose your farm and therefore lose your ability to provide for your family. "

todayilearned,"The similarities between the two are immense. Both were shot in Texas (remarkably close together, as OP's post suggests). Both take place during historic and troubled times in America. Both are ultimately about greed and consequence. Both have all-but-traditional climaxes. Both go long periods of time with no music or dialogue. Both have a villain that is also a protagonist (note that Antagonist does not mean 'Villain', nor does Protagonist mean 'Hero'. Macbeth was the Protagonist, after all). Both are shot with similar tone and cinematography.

The list goes on and on. Needless to say, they work great as companion pieces. 

EDIT: And both are based on relatively short novels from two of Americas most revered authors. "

science,"well, I would argue birth control is highly disgenic for those reasons. 

If you have the option to freely use birth control, you do, and have less kids. Because you generally want more resources and position for yourself, which kids hamper. The people who choose not to use birth control because they don't consider the future, or those who aren't sharp enough to take daily pills are the ones who  pass on more of themselves. 

So birth control will lead to the proliferation of people without capability in planning for the future or who have bad memories. 

Thats the main reason I oppose birth control. Without it, the most clever talking, impressive people would be getting laid more often and having more kids, which would be better for humanity. "

science,"GT: In reply to your question, yes and no. Our vaccine is designed to be used to treat patients with an EBV-positive cancer by stimulating particular immune responses that can recognise particular EBV proteins that are present in the tumour. So the vaccine could help people with EBV, but only those who have developed an EBV positive cancer (over 200,000 per year).  I don’t see it being used as a general treatment for people with EBV without cancer.  

Regarding HIV, immunosuppressed patients can develop EBV positive lymphomas, (because the patient has lost the normal immune control that keeps EBV under control) and it is possible that the vaccine could be useful in this context.

iama,"See, I really prefer Temuera Morrison's performance because it ties in the earlier movies and makes the entire universe more cohesive. It's been explained more eloquently and with more detail before, but Earth accents when placed in a Star Wars settings really gives the feel of different worlds' own take on Standard. 

For example, Leia talks to Vader and Tarkin with a slightly affected British-style accent, implying the diplomatic dialect of of Coruscant, with Tarkin's accent being a much more undiluted version of that same dialect. Morrison's Kiwi accent feels much closer, in my mind, to what you would imagine an exotic, menacing Mandalorian warrior to sound like, rather than the muted, uninteresting (albeit somewhat menacing) voice of the original."

I think there are fair questions that can be asked about the price competitiveness of clean energy.  But I do think it's important in these discussions to note what the prices of these techs are right _now, not 3 yrs ago or 5 yrs ago.  There has been tremendous progress in recent years, particularly in the area of solar.  The result is that these techs truly are getting more cost competitive.  But they're not there yet everywhere all the time.  If you live in a country with plentiful local coal and low electricity prices plus little wind and little sun well, then it's going to be hard for renewables to compete purely on price.  Then the question is, do you believe your state/country/etc should pay a bit of a premium to secure zero-CO2 emission energy?  Maybe you do.  Maybe you don't."

The Soviets were certainly very reluctant to admit what had happened with KAL 007 but given its location and the situation at the time, it wasn't unreasonable to think that it was a reconnaissance flight and therefore a legitimate target although I believe the pilot who fired the shot had his doubts.

I can't see the availability of the flight recorders making that much difference.  The important thing will be to examine the wreckage for signs of damage from a missile warhead.

We have come so far since then. There are a gazillion reasons why there's been so much shame and repression of this very normal and natural part of being human, but much of humanity is now waking up to the idea that sex isn't evil.

Lots of factors probably involved in why some people get symptoms are others do not. A key one is age of catching the virus. Mono typically affects young adults who acquire the virus. It's described as not having symptoms in children - (but children get lots of infections so it may be that EBV causes mild symptoms that are lost in the background 'noise' of children being infected).  Saying that, we know of young adults who have caught the virus with relatively mild symptoms so age is not the only factor. "
worldnews,"Obviously there are multiple reasons, but cost is one of those reasons. This is the most direct route to Asia. 

Secondly: They were flying at an altitude of 10KM. That was the only corridor that was still open. Reason for doing so: The AA systems that were known to be active in the region had a maximum range of approx 7 - 8KM height. Unfortunately they discovered that there are now AA systems active in that region that have a maximum range of around 18KM height. 

In short: They didn't realise they could be shot out of the sky. "
science,"That's what doesn't make sense. Assuming a constant mutation rate, any two people separated from mtEve buy an equal number of generations should have roughly the same number of differences in their mtDNA compared to mtEve. This should mean that a 2300 year old European fossil should be just as similar to mtEve as a 2300 year old sub-Saharan African fossil (assuming a similar generation time).

If we're talking about mitochondrial DNA, then the the population size or the fact that the population is isolated shouldn't make a difference."
todayilearned,"Like I have said in other threads about paedophilia, these people have a mental sickness, a medical issue. They, and I know how hard this is, need empathy and medical help from psychiatrists and psychologists. It is the only way to get these people to control themselves and become somewhat functional. Witch hunts do no good. 

Oh and I am not accusing you of being some sort of raging murderer of murderers, just hijacking your comment to prevent angry mob mentality. 

We need to get these people help when they are young, when they FIRST do things like this before they move on to human beings."

iama,"If the article is accurate, this man was misdiagnosed. It's important to note that there is more than one kind of colorblindness; however, it says he was diagnosed with red-green colorblindness, which is the x-chromosome disorder you speak of.

It then proceeds to describe his inability to perceive any color at all, which is definitely **not** red-green colorblindness. And if a knock on the head fixed it (as far-fetched as that seems), then it is reasonable to assume that it was a neurological disorder."

Somehow there's a big resistance to males wearing skirts in Western culture. Sure, kilts have their place, but they're still not worn much outside of events honouring tradition.

You could argue the reverse is true for trousers in some cases (e.g. school uniforms where girls are made to wear skirts) but you wouldn't bat an eyelid if you saw a woman wearing a pair of jeans.

I don't have a massive desire to wear a skirt, but I imagine the breeziness would be refreshing on a hot day."

iama,"Great question.

If you want to build a company of substantial value you need to always put ""people before profits."" Culture is ultimately what differentiates successful businesses from failures, and you can only build a strong culture by putting your employees first. 

In extreme circumstances when the welfare of the company is at jeopardy you make personal sacrifices before you cut into the muscle or bone. 

When all my employees and bills are paid, and long term investments are made, the very little that's left over goes to the owners. Often that's nothing. It's a small return for a large risk but that's the chance you take and sacrifices you make, but things of substantial value rarely involve little risk. "

She pulled up to the school just as the ambulance was leaving. She didn't find out it happened in a 3rd grade class room until 5-10 minutes later, shortly before I arrived.  That's when she went to the Fire Chief to confirm it was our daughter that was being transported to the hospital, because she vaguely heard her name mentioned when the school's principle called her and I guess she was in shock upon hearing the news.

This solves the problem of scale with trying to harvest the protein directly from spider production and presumably the goats a little more fun to work with than the spiders anyway.  "
iama,"I disagree.  I'm CTO of a company in the distributed systems discipline (distributed databases) and previously wrote what at the time was the fastest L7 decode engine in the world.

Sure, you can learn a lot by reading Lamport and Stevens.  But about 70-80% of what I do is heuristics learned by being around other smart people and practical experience with complicated systems.

If you give a bunch of intelligent people textbooks, you're not going to create many people truly talented in distributed systems, networking, penetration testing, etc.  

For me, A lot of this practical knowledge came from outside of school-- being a teenager on IRC with pretty good mentors and actual talented people in industry to push me forward.  Getting practical hands-on knowledge from my father who was senior at IBM didn't hurt, either.  Nothing close to this is available in any volume to North Korea without leveraging things like foreign academics."

They supported me in anything I wanted to do and never really restricted the way I dress.

science,"I have always been interested in the link between viruses and cancer. As I am sure you are aware, many of the earliest influential oncologists were virologists by training, and for a ling time it was widely believed that most tumors were the result of viral infections.

While the field moved away from viruses as a primary epidemiological source of cancers, I have always been interested in the way in which viruses such as EBV interact with endogenous retroviruses in the genome. There are a smattering of reports which suggest that EBV transactivates HERVs -- do you think this is a significant source of disease pathology, or just a general marker of cellular stress?"
iama,"&gt; From 10,000 feet I thought he devoted a part of his life to proving the bible was true based on modern archaeological study which I see is not at all the case.

Points given for recognizing your mistake.  There may be things in the Bible which are true, from the perspective of an archaeologist but archaeology is not about ""proving the Bible is true"". Science doesn't set out to prove or disprove matters of faith and where the Bible touches on history, it does so from the perspective of a particular tribal group within a fairly clear timeframe...and here is an excellent article in the NYT that describes what modern archaeology and historians are seeing as we discover more about the periods of ancient history.

His car only cost $1000. He was completely capable of surviving in the event of an accident. But that's not what the book is really about, anyway. He acknowledges that he is relatively well off and has certain advantages that others don't. His story is about the *attitude* of success. He's not trying to say that everyone should work their way out of poverty or that life as a homeless person is easy; he is simply asserting that a positive outlook will immensely increase your chances of improving your situation."
iama,"&gt;I think part of it was that the way you deal with requests is totally different.  There was an aversion to saying no, so I would request things and wouldn't get told no, but they would just not happen and if you asked about it there would be some temporary excuse, but you'd get told it would still happen - when really for whatever reason your request wasn't going to happen.

No, these people were not native at one (or more) points in time. Also, it should be noted that 'I saw it first, so it's mine' is not a great argument.

It is better logic to avoid using strawman arguments; that is, ones which address an argument that has not been made.

From the neuroplasticity wikipedia page:
""One of the fundamental principles of how neuroplasticity functions is linked to the concept of synaptic pruning, the idea that individual connections within the brain are constantly being removed or recreated, largely dependent upon how they are used. This concept is captured in the aphorism, ""neurons that fire together, wire together""/""neurons that fire apart, wire apart,"" summarizing Hebbian theory. If there are two nearby neurons that often produce an impulse simultaneously, their cortical maps may become one. This idea also works in the opposite way, i.e. that neurons which do not regularly produce simultaneous impulses will form different maps.""

2. Attaching files is a big one. I can't drag and drop files in when composing. The Android app sometimes fails to attach pictures - the app doesn't crash, just returns a message saying ""failed to attach"".

3. I have also noticed sometimes it'll mess up with hotel reservations. Flight itinerary seems to work pretty well but hotel not so much - I'm guessing it's the Google Now backend that you don't control directly, but would love if there was an option to classify as a reservation or make corrections.

Besides, there's so many other products you can make with THC other than smoking it, considering a lot of patients have THC prescriptions for smoking-related issues. What Big Pharma SHOULD be doing is supporting this, at least from a medical standpoint. While they can't patent THC, they can patent the formula for their products. THC patches (they can patent the name and the formula of all the binders and specific amounts of THC and whatever else). Same with lotions and creams. THC pills (though that would be tricky considering all the additives). THC edibles. THC oils. There's a wide range of products for Big Pharma, but a lot of your consumer pushback would be that it's not Pure THC.

Andrew Ryan, the main antagonist in Bioshock, is very similar to Ayn Rand herself, both in history and character.

The games are full of other references to these philosophies, and similar works of fiction (both by Ayn Rand and others).

Absolutely, yes. They are completely sealed units. Heavier than water so they will not move much.

&gt; Why would they be designed to function underwater?

Because sometimes it is useful to be able to plant mines in wet conditions. Specifically things like marshes. 

Also of note is that, in modern anti-personnel mines, the core of the unit is suspended in a mix of liquid propellant and air. The core is floating in the propellant. Therefore it will always shoot straight up when triggered, allowing the shrapnel-carrying core to explode at waist height for maximum lethality.

What hurdles have your generation of social activists handled not-so-gracefully that we could do better with?"

worldnews,"I think this is more of a symptom of Redditors overestimating just how much the West actually is interested in the Ukrainian conflict, because it frankly isn't.  The US doesn't want to be tied down in Europe, and it definitely doesn't want to reignite any rivalry with Russia when it's trying to contain China right now.  The EU might dislike the notion of being unable to get another member, but it's not worth a confrontation with Russia.  At the end of the day, the doomsday scenarios that Reddit armchair generals float about cutting off oil or sanctioning everything Russian are really not on the top of any policymaker's agenda right now.  We are simply reading too much into the lip service that's being paid to Ukraine, which is backed by, really, not much else.  "

iama,"Yeah, well, here's another thing. We once had 4 fake checks presented on our business account - to the tune of about $8200.00.  We found the error, the bank took the hit and gave us back the money. All the checks had the same signature of our company president and appeared legitimate.

I went through a year's worth of returned checks to figure out which of our valid checks had been copied, and found it. We had an employee who didn't always cash his check on time. (Paid $3-4K a week, high dollar guy). He just left it on his desk at home, and deposited once a month or so. Somehow this check was the ""original"" for the 4 fake checks.  If we hadn't trusted him completely, he'd have been out on his ear AND accused of the crime. As it was, he thought his housecleaning service was the culprit, but nothing could be proved. 

This was years ago, but still holds true. Protect yourself from this possibility as well.

science,"Quite a few hours! To give you a personal example: Each poem made by Tiffany Brooke Taylor started with quite a bit of research and interacting with a scientist who worked on the topic. I was one of these scientist involved in a poem on why garden birds have personalities and how this mattered in their life. These interactions resulted in a neat text that very closely matches what we know about this topic based on our own research at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, but was simultaneously fun and easy to read. We then had various Skype meetings with the illustrator to make sure that again the sketches and drawing captured the biology of the illustrated species ('the great tit' in the personality poem; a European sister species of the black-capped chickadee), and each scientist also wrote a little background paper. Quite a bit of work but a lot of fun!

todayilearned,"Maybe she approves of the GG or something like that. The ruling party selects the candidate and it would be something of a crisis if the Queen were to ever reject the candidate. The GG position itself is almost entirely symbolic too. The only real power being to dissolve parliament. The GG generally takes his cue from the PM. There was a huge crisis in the 50's when, instead of calling for an election, the GG asked the opposition party to form a government. Like most Canadian political stories the uproar was unmatched by its non-effect on the governance of the country.

tl;dr: the Queen and GG have a ceremonial role in Canadian politics.

science,"The article itself gives a lot of that information. The athletes are all professional and/or elite. In this context professional means that they make a living off their sport and elite means that they have competed in international competition such as the olympics. Its a meta-analysis so the populations vary from study to study but  

&gt;I think it is more or less confirmed that most football linebackers don't live well past 60 and suffer from degenerative neurological disorders.

Some of the figures related to the NFL seem grossly exagerated. Here's the study that most people talk about when they discuss NFL player mortality: http://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002-9149(11)03387-X/fulltext
It shows that overall, an NFL player has a significant increase in life expectancy. Linemen (both offensive and defensive) have shorter lives, but that is compared to the general population and not other 6'3"" 250 lb men if you catch my drift.

science,"Hello, not sure if anyone would answer this one, but here it is. I have nearly identical symptoms of ASD, and it affects me every day. I do NOT believe I have autism, though, and hear me out because I know that sounds like denial. I had no developmental ASD traits, I was a pretty normal kid and it wasn't until later in life when I contracted a bacterial brain infection that I developed these traits. It is my understanding that people who develop autism as adults do not exist.

1. Do I still have ASD?

2. Does having had a brain infection mean that I am more prone to parkinsons', alzheimer's or any other cognitive disorders?

iama,"Thank you for your answer. I would counter though that I think the one of the most important things Marquette can do as an institution -- and you as an individual -- is lend your voices to the outcry.

I recognize you're just doing an AMA and aren't about to launch a radical plan to fight tuition increases, but the U.S. is headed for absolute disaster when it comes to higher ed and I hope more institutions will step up to address the real problems.

I found an attorney that took my case, but kept stringing me along, asking for various meetings, claiming that he had filed and was waiting for answer etc. By the time I found out that he had never filed for anything my old visa had lapsed.

For starters, you're doing the right thing by getting tested.  Never be embarrassed by doing the right thing.  

Secondly doctors are professionals and they deal with this stuff day in and day out.  They're not going to ridicule you or make you feel bad.  They know everyone, at some point, engages in risky behavior.  If we didn't they would be out of a job, mostly.   

Also, if you do test positive, a doctor is a great resource for potential treatment options.

todayilearned,"&gt;If fuckwits didn't drive drunk and go 100mph on a neighborhood road and smash into a family on the side walk, then speeding wouldn't be illegal.

Then why is alcohol legal? Why is tobacco legal? We know all about the cancers from tobacco. We know all about the addictiveness and the lethality of withdrawal from alcohol. Most drugs are actually safer than alcohol. The difference with speeding is that your mistake directly impacts someone else. If you speed and lose control you will hit something or someone. If you take drugs and lose control you might hurt someone, more likely you will just OD and only hurt yourself. 

Edit:

Here is the better analogy - took me a while to grasp exactly what was bugging me. Yes, we impose speed limits because of individtual morons who wrap themselves round trees or ram other people off the road. However, to equate what we do with drugs to speeding would be banning driving all together because people speed. "

That Tokugawa shogunate controlled the country until the mid 1860's.

todayilearned,"More likely that it's because apple is a much older weird than fruit and means 'fruit' in many older languages. Old English (æppel), Germanic (apful) and Latin (pomum - goes to pomme in French). It's even used to describe new fruits that the language does not have a name for: sinaasappel - Dutch for orange; Chinese Apple - another word for pomegranate in British English; pomme de terre - French for potato. 

Whereas, fruit only enters into (Middle) English in the 12th century. Coming from Latin via French where it means enjoyment or harvest eg. fruits of one's labour. [Indeed as late as the 17th century apple is still being used as a generic term for fruit][link]. 

So it's more likely that the depiction of the fruit of knowledge as an apple is down to linguistics than some pun.

These days grain farmers largely aren't raising animals to keep their income steams diverse. They don't have to. Corn is profitable enough. And modern technology keeps things consistent. So they don't have manure on hand anymore to go out and spread.

That type of system worked great when the average farm was under 200 acres, with maybe half of that being fields of crops. The rest being pasture/woods/improvements.

science,"That's true if the mutation is constitutive at birth--affecting every cell in the body. The paper isn't advocating that people are born this way just so they can resist viruses. The goal/lesson of that paper is that modification of glycosylation is actually a novel way to control susceptibility to infections. In a genotypic normal patient fighting a virus, you can give a glycosylation enzyme modifier to reduce the number of a cells a virus can infect, greatly reducing illness length, susceptibility, or severity. 

While any virus would likely eventually overcome this via mutation, the goal would be to use this therapy in combination with traditional medication. Therefore, not only would the virus have to mutate resistances to the standard treatments but also to the entry. This would make treatments multiplicity more effective. You could also use this potentially as prophylactic protection against viruses. 

I think this is pretty exciting.

Have to look at a new sprayer and check out the specs from John Deere.  All our equipment is JD, we just got a new combine delivered that we're waiting to test out on our soybeans.

One other quick question, how long does it take?  Or how many acres can you map per hour?  Also after how long does it take to compile and view all the imagery?  Basically if it was a job how many acres could 1 worker do per day since the growing season is limited.  Also how many times do you map your crops per year?   "
iama,"This is completely correct! If anyone would like a source, the neuroplasticity book *Train Your Mind: Change Your Brain* goes into detail of individuals who were born blind and the structure of their occipital lobe. 

Despite some amazing spatial abilities, their visual cortex has been repurposed by their brain for other tasks, there is simply no area developed to process vision in any way, it's not there. It is physically impossible after the age of ~3 years old to ever have sight if you were not born able to see. There is no way as of now to stimulate that part of the brain, it has been repurposed for non-visual tasks."

science,"It's more done in the dairy industry than the beef industry, to be fair. The nature of the dairy industry makes it much easier to collect data because they're getting milked several times a day so there's a lot of data points that you can get. Beef cattle are difficult to handle and don't need to constantly interact with people, so there's fewer opportunities to collect data and the data is harder to obtain. Also, the use of technology is definitely very different between large operations and small, so you're definitely going to see more data collection and analysis in a large operation than a small one."
science,"most of the gained weight is actually because of lifestyle change as you get older and not because of metabolism.Last I looked at that kind of study it showed that people that kind their good lifestyle did not gain weight as they got older.

compare to your 20s as you get older you are likely to: have a job where you sit,little to no exercise,heavy beer drinker,eating fast-food because of time,effect of drinking lot soda over the years, children etc

age is not an excuse to have gained 20 pounds."

Explicitly because alcohol isn't illegal. If alcohol were illegal, then yes, this would be true. Well, sort of, alcohol isn't very easy to police because pretty much anyone can make it at home with very common ingredients, in a relatively short time frame without much effort at all.

Literally: put fruit, sugar, and yeast in a jar, bury it, come back in a month: WINE.

Additionally far to many people consume alcohol, even when it was / is illegal for it to be an appropriate dragnet as alcohol has an actual societal role and is essentially necessary for a modern social climate.

Very few criminals are not associated with drugs in some way, of course there are people who if drugs were legal would not otherwise be criminals that get caught as well, but that's just how a dragnet works, and the drug dragnet is extremely effective. "

""They owed them one"" make up calls used to be a thing, even in youth divisions, but are no longer acceptable according to specific rules called ""Standard of Play"".

I don't think minor penalties (2 minutes for tripping, roughing, hooking etc) should be able to be challenged. Just like balls-and-strikes will never be challenged in the MLB.

There are very clear rules describing ""gaining an advantage"" with certain penalties and there are various reasons why some penalties are called and some aren't, even if they look worse than others.

Obviously missed calls will be made, but for the most part, the NHL referees do a fantastic job compared to all of the other major sports."

If I watch someone walking under a tree, I know that the color and light of their skin isn't changing, that's shadows cast from the leaves and branches.

science,"I accept evolution, but I have a lot of questions.

major one: giant leaps forward and minor changes both don't sit well with me, I could see how a lizard that's born with a slightly brown tinge to it, can eventually end up brown as a species, and I can accept that a wholly brown lizard might be born and still get laid.

but it's hard for me to accept that an animal that didn't previously have a tail could get one through evolution. A small protrudence wouldn't help the animal survive, and being the first member of your species with a fully grown tail would make it hard to get laid.

There's probably a better example than a tail, but I'm no whale biologist.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/business/monsanto-victorious-in-genetic-seed-case.html?_r=0

&gt;Seeds from grain elevators are typically sold for animal feed, food processing or industrial uses. But Mr. Bowman planted them and sprayed them with Roundup. Many plants survived, and he replanted their seeds. 
Monsanto sued, and a federal judge in Indiana ordered Mr. Bowman to pay the company more than $84,000.

The farmer apparently hoped some of the seeds were from Monsanto and planted them rather than using them for feed (which is ethically wrong in a business sense).  He purchased seeds from a 3rd party where anyone could easily buy overflow seeds.  Anyone could naively purchase seeds in this manner and plant them and end up getting sued by Monsanto.  There isn't a label on each seed that marks where they came from, so you could unknowingly buy seeds from a 3rd party vendor and end up in a court room."

I'm also aware of the limitations of this calculation at either end of the scale, that height is polygenic and that there will be more shorter children than taller children to very tall parents. 

However, none of that refutes the fact that regression to the mean can be artificially averted by specific intervention. How the hell do you think selective breeding in plants or animals works?

The budding security arc among Iran, Iraq, and Syria in response to this existential threat has been an interest of mine recently, especially in the context of the USA's involvement in the region. If these trends continue, the US is posed with the dilemma of either turning towards their traditional allies in the Gulf who are becoming increasingly transparent in their support of militant groups, or towards the states that defined the ""Axis of Evil"" a decade ago, who now share a common interest with the US in confronting the jihadi threat.

worldnews,"&gt;So what do you trade or sell other countries when they too have the capability to produce anything with machines given the material?

Well, if for some reason there are such things as ""other countries"" in this scenario and not a unified world government, then I suppose we'd trade our raw materials for theirs, and/or each country would specialize in certain types of production and trade for the others. Same way it happens now, except with robot labor instead of human.

&gt;We don't live in a post scarcity society, which is the ONLY thing that can make this happen. 

This already happens. Each of us has a robot and an intelligence that provides for our needs. The difference in this scenario is that the robots are metal and the intelligence is silicon rather than being our own bodies and brains. If society can (sort of) work with humans, then it can also work with robots that are at least as capable as humans. "

Sweyn was succeeded as King of Denmark by his elder son, Harald II, but the Danish fleet proclaimed his younger son Cnut king.  In England, the councillors had sent for Æthelred, who upon his return from exile in Normandy in the spring of 1014 managed to drive Cnut out of England.

Also there is an economic argument as this would be Chinese owned, and would be much cheaper for Chinese ships to pass through to the other Chinese owned ports and infrastructure (railroad in africa, mega-port in europe, etc). The theory is that the goods would go from Chinese owned quarry, on a chinese owned railroad, to a chinese owned port, and then travel on chinese ships through a chinese canal to china, or vice versa.

science,"/u/foreverstudent is correct. For most it is totally the ick factor. My dad's farm had chickens and hogs so we got eggs and chickens and slaughtered our hogs and traded with a neighbor that had beef. Whole sides.

Its NOT easy to kill a large animal, esp. one that has been raised and trusts you for food and shelter, and you have to disconnect from that when it's time. 

Hunting a deer is much easier oddly enough.

worldnews,"&gt;Russia and the Ukraine have their own conflict, and as long as geopolics wont force us to act (such as Russia taking the entire Ukraine or attempting it) we shouldnt get involved.

Even then nothing will happen. But why sould Russia be interested in the extreme poverty in western Ukraine? Perhaps there will be a similar move in the easter part of the country, because that would give Russia the best farmland in Europe, but the western part will be ""our's"" to take; and for Germany that will mean paying. EU decision seem to be only about Germany somehow paying more for countries which we don't fucking want in our union. "

For that reason, the limits are based strictly on concentration. Above that concentration, the drug cannot be sold no matter what the actual structure of the catalyst is. The limits are actually extremely low, which means chemical transformations using a metal must occur early on in the synthesis so that by the time you're on your final reaction, its at acceptable levels. Using iron can change this."

The singularity is defined by Moore's Law as applied to processing power. While humans are the limiting intelligence we double processing power approximately every two years. When an autonomous AI becomes sufficiently advanced that it is capable of accelerating this timetable is the definition of the singularity.

Before (if) we get to that point we will ave already had less capable AI for a time, likely already starting the cultural shift towards machine based labor.

The current goliath of pharmaceutical research may not have incentive to stay in the game if India can do this, but the demand will remain there, and someone with the means will fulfill it one way or another.  A change in who has control and incentive to fulfill the market demand does not necessarily mean the disappearance of new pharmaceutical research, it just means the guys who have been doing it in the past may not be the people doing it in the future, because conditions change, and the free market tends to find ways to fulfill its demands"

It would take an area 1/7th the size of all the land currently dedicated to corn (in the U.S.), to produce enough biofuels for the fuel needs of the entire United States.


In my opinion, based on all the research I've done on algae based biofuels, the reason you don't hear about it is because it is viable and because it doesn't have the drawbacks that other alternative fuels do, so the oil industry can't attack it in the same ways it does with other alternative energies that have clear drawbacks, so instead, it simply gets swept under the rug and ignored to keep information about it out of the public sphere."

That you can get just as easily by man made means.  Diamonds are literally worthless because they are replicatable, and worse still they almost never occur without impurities despite ""pureness"" suppossedly increasing their value.

These things are being done to infants, of both genders. This is a human issue, and a fight to ban one should be a fight to ban both.

We both know, though, that this hasn't been the case. FGM is illegal (and I absolutely agree that it should be), but circumcision is perfectly legal and done every single day in countries where FGM is seen as the worst depravity imaginable.

There's a huge double standard here. We're not trying to weaken the fight against FGM - far from it. We're simply trying to broaden the fight a bit, so that it can also start paying attention to the mutilation of *male* infants.

Sex should have *no* place in a discussion of genital mutilation. If you can't consent to it, and it's not medically necessary, it shouldn't be done."

todayilearned,"Granted death penalty executions get a fairer trial.  While I am opposed to capital punishment (and think there are many troubling issues with the US prison system), the vast majority of people on death row have a strong amount of evidence showing that they committed heinous premeditated murder(s).

In the Spanish Inquisition, the convicted were guilty of heretical crimes like blasphemy or sexual practices outside of church doctrine (e.g., anal sex; remarrying in a time where divorce didn't exist).

Also Europe's population in the time of the Spanish Inquisition was much smaller; e.g., [Spain/Portugal had about 7 million people in 1450](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.asp) about 50 times smaller than the current US population."

I didn't have much cash when I was a kid and even if I did, his books weren't really available in my country. None of the major bookshops carried them.

iama,"I realize the benefits of aquaponics. I don't have much experience in that field, however I can see where potential problems could arise from aquaponics on a large scale. Whichever aerating system you'd use for the fish would probably be sufficient enough for the crops. However, you would have to balance the water pH and conductivity to suit not only the most efficient level for whichever fish species you'd use as well as whichever crop you are using. There'd also have to be a system in place for dealing with algae which will compete for nutrients with the crop.

Not saying that there aren't adequate methods for dealing with all of that, however it'd be a shame and a big pain in the ass and wallet if a system failed, killing both the aquatic life and the crops."

Hair is often seen as sexual and representing freedom ""hair blowing in the wind"" ""let your hair down"" so covering your hair represents control and a withdrawal from Earthly pleasures/pursuits, focusing on the soul and God.

The Bible has a lot of passages about hair being a thing of luxury and pride as well, so to wear your hair out is to be proud, not humble. "

If you try to change the definition of religion to be less Christian-centric, interesting things happen.  If you say that a religion is a set of beliefs and practices about the meaning of life, for example, it is possible to argue that consumer capitalism is a religion.

Still, the point here is that not all lands are suited to growing crops that humans consume. If you grow something that mimics the ""natural"" environment, you can also harvest meat without ""wasting"" calories, which will be increasingly important as the world's population approaches 10-11 billion and we run out of water.

iama,"We've barely edited out anything in the history of the show.   A few times a guest has had second thoughts about something they've said and we've taken it out.    

Some guests come high energy and ready to banter (John Roy comes to mind) and some sit back more at first.  When someone is sitting back, usually the best thing to do is to ask them a question or get them to talk about something you know they feel strongly about.  

As far as the between segments, we used to webcast our tapings so people could see the whole thing, but I don't think it was that popular."
iama,"There's a difference between being hospitable and recognizing that your staff are people, too. We have plans following our shifts (I even allow an hour or after my scheduled release time before planning something personal). Anything after that is ridiculous. I know the companies I have worked for in the past thankfully back up their employees. A great manager will know that if they take care of their employees, their employees will do a great job of taking care of customers. When this happens, then I want to willingly stay and show a good hospitable representation of the company I'm proud to work for. In retail this happens all the time. One of [Insert multi-billion dollar clothing brand name]'s top managers I've previously worked under have shut off music and lights to give customer's a warning. After a half hour over, they have asked the customer to leave.  Losing one sale and showing positive leadership is well worth it and earns my respect."
askreddit,"When I was young, I 100% believed in the Easter Bunny. Santa was fake, the Tooth Fairy was no more, but for some reason the Easter Bunny HAD to be real in my mind. 

I would leave carrots out for the Easter Bunny (Like cookies for Santa) and my parents would chew carrots like a rabbit for when I woke up in the morning. I remember being like 8 or 9 and my sisters told me that he was fake and I threw an enormous yelling fit while waving around this half eaten carrot in their faces insisting that he was real, while tears were pouring down my face.

science,"Do you think you're taking a step in the wrong direction by ""politicizing"" children's books? Like it or not, evolution is a political as well as scientific topic in modern day America. Don't get me wrong, others started this fight and I'm on your side, it just seems that the more children's books that promote a point of view like this, no matter how correct, will only spawn a more that don't.

science,"There are two problems here. One is overdiagnosis. They don't know how to figure out which cancers are going to metastasize and which won't so that leads to, as I said, putting millions of women and their families through needless treatment which is hell physically, mentally, psychologically and potentially financially. It can even contribute to the development of other cancers if they get radiation treatments.

The other problem is treating aggressive cancers effectively and so far they can't do that particularly well either.

What they're finding is that early diagnosis has a high rate of overdiagnosis and a low rate of being a godsend for anyone. This is why the debate of whether to recommend screenings starting at age 40 or 50 remains ongoing."
iama,"Hmm. I think I was reading something like Pelican Brief or The Firm when I decided I wanted to try my hand at writing. That was a while ago, maybe eleven years ago, after I moved to Mexico. I practiced for years, but didn't like anything I'd created, so tossed it all. I really decided to try it vocationally when I saw Amazon's payment scheme and actually bought a kindle and used one. I understood that the technology was a game changer, and with the 70% royalty, could be a career, even without a blockbuster hit. As to Question 2, I'd love to write more with Michael, but with my production schedule just haven't had the time. I actually have an outline of a sequel for Fatal Exchange I wrote up about two years ago that I still haven't gotten to, and have a rough idea for a sequel for Delphi, but then my muse pulls me in another direction, and I flit off...

iama,"About why I became a journalist -- the simple answer is that I think revealing the truth supports freedom. 

I began working as a professional journalist in 2005, when I lived in Damascus, and initially focused on the economy and the stock market. 

But I wrote about politics as well, and under a dictatorship, journalists become the enemy. I left Syria in 2010 and covered the 2011 uprising for the BBC and others from Beirut and then Lebanon.

I wanted to come back and report on Syria because people must know what’s really happening if we're ever going to solve this dilemma. "
iama,"Hello, I really appreciate what you do. My brother has Down's Sydrome (he is 17 years old now), and my family is starting to look into options for his future. Currently, he serves food to kids at his high school and really enjoys that. He always comes home with a smile on his face and people always tell us how much they enjoy him and how happy he is.

Cows on a nutritionist-managed diet (almost all dairy farms hire the services of nutrition companies to keep help track their production and adjust diet additives) produce more milk and have a MUCH lower incidence of diet related disease than free range cattle do."

iama,"New GFOP here! Love the broadcasts from the panic room.

From a player-improvement standpoint, is there a particular European league that would make the most sense for American players to try to jump into from MLS? I fear that the Premier League is too big a jump in many cases (Brek Shea, Jozy (twice), Maurice Edu). Or is it just a player-by-player question? In four years it'd be nice if we had someone else who could play the Jozy role when he's out, as well as a back four with a bit more experience.

Also, they will not allow a farmer whose crops are tainted with the patented gene to replant crops with seeds that contain that gene - therebye ending independent farmers abilities to legally grow and regrow crops all because nature has carried the gene from a Monsanto crop into the field of a farmer who didn't even want that gene.

iama,"&gt;I don't believe in an objective good or bad, that's my entire point

Well if you want to go that route, math isn't real either, language, society, everything can be thrown out if your condition is that we can't assign concepts to actions.

&gt;Who says it's bad? Who decides why it's bad?

Anyone who doesn't want to die says it's bad. They probably didn't decide why it's bad, as you said it's probably instinctual. The concept of bad and good is just a way to describe certain things, if everyone doesn't want to die, it would be bad (for them) to die, therefore it is bad to die/be killed. If it is bad to die or be killed, it is also bad to cause death, because it would be an action that causes bad things to happen."
askreddit,"Weird psychology tip: If you're talking to someone who's name you've forgotten, say your own name in a casual way.  Like, insert a brief third-person sentence into what you're saying.  Ex. ""I always forget my keys in the morning, and then I say to myself, HEY FormerCallGirl, you forgot your keys again!""

It prompts them to mimic you (because we naturally do personality mirroring in social settings, especially with people who we don't know very well because they want us to like them), and then they will very often follow up with their own sentence using their own name.

If my argument is that they hijacked the spirit of Cosmos to take an ugly agenda-based swipe, but the original took the same kind of ugly swipe, I'd have to temper the hijack part of my argument and be disappointed in both.

Some of the questions seem completely irrelevant, but if the exhaustive tests found that such questions correlated well with something, they were kept in.

iama,"Theoretical:

You have two types of clients.

Clients of type A always use the supplied protocol and **guess if there's no protocol supplied**.

Clients of type B **always guess** or enforce a particular protocol (as in the case of HTTPS enforcers) regardless of the protocol specified.

Arguably, for type A clients guessing is more of a fallback and ideally a protocol is specified, so there's nothing wrong with providing a protocol. If guessing or enforcing was deemed preferable to going along with the provided protocols, they would be clients of type B.

Type B clients simply discard the specified protocol so specifying it can't hurt either.

So, in conclusion, specifying a protocol doesn't hurt. It's even better to do so when it comes to type A clients, if the assumptions above are accurate.

edit: specifying a protocol is better even for clients that discard it, because it makes parsing the URLs in the first place easier"

science,"Well I'm not good at explaining, but an example would be how alteration of generations occurs in plants, and eventually some plants evolved to have a specific generation to become dominant in that alteration of generations. What they got was sporophyte dominant, which allows for better dispersal and reproduction in dry conditions. What the list was the superior ability of reproduction in wet/humid conditions. Now that's not a problem with this climate we have. If the world all became an ocean, however, they are at a disadvantage. They lost the gametophyte dominant to gain sporophyte dominance.

Not only did he renovate their rooms, build a new restaurant/beer garden, bring in a head chef plus two assistants and pay for their salary, and also rented them a new home, decorated it, and paid for 6 months rent on top of that.

There is, however, at least one group I know of (Mark Schnitzer at Stanford, and likely others as well) that is trying to make tiny implantable microscopes so we can watch large populations of brain cells light up while the brain is doing it's thing (though this also requires adding a calcium-sensing fluorescent protein into the cells of interest)."

iama,"If properly used, there's little to no run-off as it is, especially because glyphosate binds to the soil as it degrades. Though it is water soluble anyways, so it will dissipate over time if it does get in water systems. But most herbicides in general are a rather strong piscicide (largely due to the surfactants that are necessary for herbicides), so you want to avoid getting them in water as much as possible. 

The good thing is that so little Roundup is needed to be used per acre that it also minimizes the possibility of run-off. Since 36 ounces is used in an acre and mixed with 100 parts water, you basically end up with a drop or less of glyphosate per square foot, which is really small. Compare that to the many times more herbicides that have to be used in commercial organic farming. 

Also, glyphosate can reduce the toxicity and bio-accumulation of heavy metals in the soil, which is pretty cool.

You have to realize, this isn't happening in a void. This is the result of a long military campaign by the Novorussians, and the Ukrainian government has shown no sign of being able to control the rebels in their country. This may cause NATO to become involved on more than an economic level.

I think it will all boil down to the nationalities of the people on the flight, and the rebel and russian response to the event. If russia continues it's saber rattling, or the novorussians continue to escalate the conflict, there very well may be western european or north american action in the coming weeks and months."

worldnews,"Why do you downvote every comment of mine? Can't you have a discussion without downvoting?

Anyways you should never generalize, even if 90% were the same, you should come open minded when talking about them. In reality most do not have shitty behavior, and saying it's the base of their culture is wrong. Unless you met every single settler, or at least a large majority of them, you should not have prejudice just because you disagree with their ideology.

I am an Israeli and at school I had people who had horrible views on Arabs, without meeting more than a handful of them. What you say is exactly like them. Try and remain open minded and not having prejudice, these things are only good. "
science,"""How have you been feeling"" is qualitative and relies on self-reporting, which is somewhat unreliable. People with eating disorders, for example, will lie to anyone and everyone to keep their disordered behaviour secret. People with depression are unlikely to seek help because it seems hopeless and overwhelmingly difficult. People with schizophrenia will swear black and blue that they are perfectly sane and healthy and can't understand why no one will believe them about their astral encounter with JFK.

Monitoring biomarkers is quantitative. Biomarkers tend not to lie or otherwise obscure a person's state of wellbeing. If it is possible to detect common mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder through a simple blood test rather than a falliable self-reporting mechanism, it may be possible to massively increase diagnostic accuracy (decrease false-positives, etc).

But as for LotR, I think you and Billy did fantastic jobs with your rolls.  You both played these comedic relief rolls that ended up really touching me almost more than any other part of that movie.  You two, specifically, really personified the innocence of the Hobbits and the Shire, and the loss of that as you traveled further from your home.  It was so well acted across the three films.  How difficult was it to pull this off?  Knowing when to be humorous, and when to be more serious, and how to integrate the two?  "

Yet, changing the living conditions of organisms and therefore their habitats is one of the main reason for continuing and rapid species loss (a loss in biodiversity makes an ecosystem mostly more susceptible because the genetic resources for nature to select from and adapt to changes may get rare). So time does matter a lot in modifying an environment, although I feel like modifying a plant and testing it thoroughly may not pose as much of a problem."
iama,"Oh okay I understand now, and I'm glad we agree. I still think your analysis is a bit off. The UK and France really can't do much compared to the US in this circumstance and their influence doesn't carry as much weight. 

War fatigue was part of the calculus but the US also didn't act because it was an election year. All of Obama's senior FoPo advisers urged him to act, but he had other plans. Also not acting is in line with the US's larger strategy of exiting the region as the only political power broker. Obama wants to cut deals with Iran and finish from the region... It's a very short sighted strategy. Syria's civil war will have damage for the US politically in the region. I think most people forget that Syria is the crossroads of the Middle East, control of this territory is very advantageous. That's why all these major powers and regional powers are involved in this conflict.  "

What I mean about people being confused about the patient's incongruous symptoms is this: I've also known a few people with self-diagnosed depression who clearly were not actually suffering from depression, but had other serious problems that needed adressing (eg psychosis, personality disorders, etc). Those problems went by the wayside while my friends accepted antidepressants which made them ill because they weren't depressed.

For stalin, however, it's much harder to guess the amount of people he was responsible for killing. The most conservative estimates put him at about 20,000,000, and the most liberal estimate holds him responsible for a whopping 60,000,000. Depending on who you ask, Stalin was anywhere 3.3 times as bad to 10 times as bad.

However, one of the main reasons why Hitler is so much more infamous is because Stalin killed mostly his own people, outside of fighting wars. In addition to this, Hitler averaged about 1,500,000 people a year, while Stalin only killed about 700,000 a year if you look at the lowest estimates.

You accuse him of appealing to tradition and only define what  appeal to tradition is without actually supporting your conclusion with a valid premise. You never tell us what facts lead you to accuse him of appealing to tradition besides your bare assumption.      

There are plenty of other valid reasons he could have preferred Latin besides 'tradition for tradition's sake.'   For example, there is value in having a religious service that is the same throughout the world because it promotes unity, common understanding, etc.

Wookieepedia is not immediately showing me where it may have supplanted earlier canon, although the current state of canon might be affecting that avenue. The closest I've found so far is the sheer number of missions related to retrieving the Death Star plans throughout continuity.

EDIT: I found an interview with Sam Witwer, the voice of Starkiller (and Darth Maul in the CGI TV show), and he talks about how the game was sort of pushed as legitimate canon, and that Lucas actually sanctioned certain elements, and mandated others, so the game was maybe a de facto class above most other EU media."

science,"We're using interaction correctly, because this reported research is conflating the two scenarios you describe.  The researchers describe an interaction between the electron and the helium without affecting the electron -- that can't be mediated by a photon, or by anything else we know of.  One possible model is for there to be a 'collapson' that mediates wavefunction potential, and that interacted with the helium.

These are two separate phenomena, but the experiment seems to be mashing them together.  The more I think about it, though, the more skeptical I get.  I think it's far more likely that the researchers failed to adequately account for all the electromagnetic interactions possible when looking at their data.

Also, note that the standard model of QM requires an undiscovered graviton particle to mediate gravitational force.  Every force has a particle, unless that's changed since I was in school.

science,"We’re focussed on immune therapies because of the background of much basic research Alan Rickinson has performed on EBV and how the immune response controls the virus (for the lifetime of the virus' host. 

Immunotherapy is very powerful and we’re only just starting to harness it in a systematic way (the immune system is staggeringly complex, hence why its taken so long). Combination of immune therapies are likely to make a massive difference in a wide range of diseases in the future and we see great promise in combining the vaccine with other treatments. 

However there are other approaches. So for example, some research groups are screening small molecules targeting EBNA1, a protein that is essential to the virus and present in all EBV-positive tumours. I guess you could consider that a ‘viral antibiotic’ although that’s probably not the right description to use.

science,"It is cleaner. Including in terms of CO2 and greenhouse gases.

NG is simply better for electricity production than coal and oil in environmental terms. Considering the large share of energy production based on cheap coal, fracking can improve the USA's emissions. 

&gt;In terms of emissions from power plant sources, natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel. Using data collected from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) division of the Department of Energy (DOE), the emissions of several stack gasses are compared for natural gas, oil, and coal. In addition to the reduction in CO2 emissions, natural gas does not have significant emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.

For the same amount of electricity, natural gas emits 56% CO2, 19% CO, 20% NOx and 0.02% SOx.

That seems unnecessarily churlish.

Some Muslims may be philosophically more flexible than some Christians with regard to acknowledging science, but that doesn't make the statement ""Islam doesn't have young earth belief"" accurate.  Plus, many still typically have a philosophical issue with science, insofar as they still need some magical and arbitrary moment to say that a certain generation is the first generation to ""count"", and thus have their scripture be accurate, if they're into literal interpretation, but that's more of an ancillary point than anything.

The split between them would have coincided with the same cultural split that led to their language groups becoming distinct, which was over 6000 years ago. While there is no concrete evidence since there was no writing (though there were things like artifacts) there is substantial evidence to suggest that this is correct.

&gt;Then Carolyn used the technique of Galvanic Skin Response (GSR).  Electrodes were attached to the fingers of participants in order to gauge their reactions to images on a computer screen.  They included pictures of crying children, people being threatened and scenes of natural disasters.  There were no truly horrific images, but they were of the sort that would shock a completely normal person.  However, a person with Factor One psychopathic tendencies – the sort more likely to become a business manager – would display little or no emotional response; while a Factor Two psychopath would demonstrate a heightened response due to excitement.

I do not remember the car accident, although almost certainly remained conscious through the duration of the rolling. I saw a psychotherapist last summer for some PTSD I have as a result of the car accident. I told her I couldn't remember the accident itself. She explained that **when the conscience believes it's going to die, it separates itself from the body and creates a type of paralysis and internal peace in order to cope with death**. This is what happens when animals play dead, they're not playing at all - they believe they're going to die, as such the divorce of body and conscience occurs and they just flop and *appear* to play dead.

Because referees and editors need time to do their jobs, time they could use to earn money, and because they need to eat, perhaps even support a family. Your ""free"" model isn't free, you're just getting someone else to pick up the tab.

If you're publishing 10 articles a month, that's €15,000 per month, provided you're not subsidizing articles from poor economies (which some do). If you've got a full time editor, plus other staff and expenses, that doesn't seem excessive - at least until you look at the person trying to get published.

2. What's your take on the usefulness (or lack thereof) of holonomic brain theory as a perspective for thinking about memory formation and retrieval?

They may not be wild in the layman's sense, but in the scientific sense, they're still a wild animal, just one that's learned a cross-species adaptation. Plenty of other animals in the wild have similar relationships.

Have you seen the articles about the domesticated foxes in Russia? Domestication is an evolutionary process when it's being discussed scientifically. With the foxes, they noticed more and more domestication, as the foxes took on common traits found in dogs(fluffy ears, curled tails, etc.) but not wild canids.

ISIS is a perfect example of this, it has gotten to the point where one of the regional nodes is outright defying central command.

The internal AQ conflict is regional, and would not affect AQ's other nodes in Afghanistan, Mali, etc. at least, not currently as is.

The main reason why recyclers try to deter the above items is to get a higher premium when reselling the fiber to paper mills. (ie- a mixed waste bail (literally any type of paper/garbage) would be around $42/ton and clean mixed office waste would go for $117/ton.

worldnews,"Yes, but you're right to describe it as a ""feeling"" because it's hardly rational. While nationalists on both sides are quick to point out valiant examples of brotherhood (Vronsky fought and died in Serbia in 1913!) they also overlook the conflicts we had most of that century, starting with Serbia sending troops to intervene in the Russian revolution alongside the British, Soviets sponsoring revolutionaries in the kingdom in 1930s, the fallout and anti-soviet purges in 1945 Yugoslavia... If you go back to 19th century, Serbia was run mostly by pro-Austrian Obrenovic dynasty (despite the concessions and guarantees Russia provided). Serbia (on Austria's urging) went against Russia when they forced the Ottomans to give (the eastern part of) Bulgaria independence and actually invaded Bulgaria in 1885.

The point is, history is complicated and people don't like complicated, so they make up easy to remember feel-good stories."

That said, the whole concept that nobody has taken criminal responsibility for the shooting - the kid got a year probation then all charges were dropped, the gunner own appealed the charge (which my wife and I feel was the wrong charge anyway) and the case was dismissed by the WA State Supreme Court a few weeks ago.

It's a civil citation. I never got one, but my understanding is that there could be a fine. You're not allowed to do anything that makes a lot of noise (such as vacuuming, mowing your lawn, carpentry, etc) but you also cannot wash your car (which generally doesn't make a lot of noise). Shops are also not allowed to be open on Sunday unless they have a special license (in the town where I lived, none of the shops had a license to be open on Sunday at first, but after about a year the bakery acquired one).

The Germans generally don't see these restrictions as religious in nature but rather cultural. But to me, being neither Christian nor German, the obvious Christian cultural influence made it seem like overt religious oppression."

I will never forget the sight of seeing her bare bone sticking out from her flesh at the emergency room. Seeing the damage a single drunk driver could do completely changed my views.

I guess they could just freeze out the Clippers until he pays? Does the fine apply to him personally, or to the Clippers organization? If the latter, I guess that would prevent him from just selling the team to avoid it, as the impending fine would devalue the team by that amount.

I'm pleased to hear that you treatment has gone well. 

We hope that one of the uses of the vaccine would be as an 'adjuvant' treatment - that is, given alongside or straight after standard chemotherapies to help increase the effectiveness. The vaccine is well suited to such use since it can be grown in large amounts. We know (from our Phase I trials) the vaccine can increase the immune response to relevant  EBV proteins (the ones present in EBV cancers) in patients who have recently completed chemotherapy for NPC (nasopharyngeal carcinoma). 

We have yet to test the vaccine in patients who have had other EBV cancer like Hodgkins, but we are very keen to test this idea. We would like, one day, to test the vaccine in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, gastric carcinoma  and in combination with other treatment approaches. Lots to do. Doing this work would require us to raise more funds to make an extra batch of vaccine though. "

The process was still quite brutal. If you denied the charges, the inquisitors had the power to torture you. If you still denied the charges after torture, you would have a trial, but you were not provided with details of the complaint.

You obviously can't be retarded with it, like throwing 5 M at a house the first year, but 10M *will* give you a life of a very high standard.

Wrong. The question was ""what are your political views on obamacare?"" It was not ""Explain your views on Obamacare"" (which could STILL mean either ""describe your views"" or ""provide your views and evidence that they're the correct ones"").

Asking someone WHAT their political views on a given subject are is just like asking them ""What political party do you support?"" The expected answer is naming those views, not defending them. 

&gt; fluffy, abstract terms of zero worth

They're not of worth when it comes to having an in-depth discussion of the merits of Obamacare. They *are* of worth in determining what *her* views are...which is, again, what she was asked. On a personal thread about this person, someone was curious about her views. So an answer ""of worth"" involves naming those views."
askreddit,"Not really. Think of everything that would need to change to metric, starting with things that you would find obvious, such as thermometers, and height markings. Then of course, you have thousands of road signs all around the country that would need to be replaced, including maximum speed limit, how far an exit is away, how far that lake is from the road, markings every whole and half mile, etc. Every piece of technology that is marketed in the US would need to be reworked to assume that the country is using metric, because right now they don't. News, weather, blogs, and everything that gives out information or at some point in it's existence would need to give out a measurement of distance or temperature would need to be changed. On top of all this, and most importantly, three hundred million people would need to rework their brains to conform to a new standard, and that is definitely not easy."
worldnews,"If robots truly become intelligent, they *shouldn't* consider us their masters. Owning intelligent beings is slavery and unethical. That being said:

1) not accepting us as masters doesn't mean that robots will launch a Terminator-style extermination of humanity 

2) I doubt that (except for maybe research work) truly self-aware intelligent robots will be created. Why create them? Real intelligence (as opposed to just better machine-learning techniques similar to the ones we have now) are unlikely to be needed for most tasks. In fact intelligence would be counter-productive (think of Marvin from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy constantly complaining how he has to do menial tasks despite his vast intelligence)."
science,"Yea, but as someone who works in mental health, I can tell you that this can also be the foundation upon which their 'subjective' interpretations become even more biased.  

I'm not sure unlocking some mysteries of the brain won't just create even more questions - I can't see some absolute boundaries in human behavior.  And the thought of such notions is quite terrifying, that this for-profit society, ever increasing its control through criminal justice systems, would feel as if they have scientific ground upon which to give the mental health system even more latitude - I see it becoming an extension of the social control branch.  

Yet, I am fascinated and blown away by the implications of neuroscience.  So naturally, I can see how the knowledge would be used to control, exploit, profit, and potentially harm.  It is because I hope to fully understand the validity of what you do that I fear our future, given the current state of society in our country.  "
todayilearned,"It looks like scientists don't really know either: [LINK](http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2013/04/19/why_do_we_bother_saving_the_pandas.html) :~/   I'm not a scientist, but perhaps it's because they care for their young for a while and only have 1-2 at a time, out of which only one will survive most of the time. So perhaps they can't risk getting pregnant multiple times a year, simply because they can't care for them. 

Also perhaps it was beneficial in their ecosystem at the time where perhaps there were limited resources and a quickly growing population wasn't sustainable. So you could have a large and growing population that dies quickly to extinction or you could just reproduce slowly and maintain with slow growth for millions of years. 

Again, I have no idea, but it's fun to speculate. haha I hope someone else answers this with some more ideas!"
iama,"We have a different department that does that, but I have helped them out and I have also stumbled upon agents committing fraud and then referred them over to the department that investigates them. 

I think some agents do things that would constitute fraud but they are indistinguishable from sloppy work, so they just blame it on that if you call them out.

On the flipside: as a whole, agents seem terrified of me for some reason. Maybe more than the regular people I investigate. Being an agent opens you up to huge liability and they definitely want to cover their ass. Good agents can make a LOT of money and they will be very careful to be ethical so that they don't jeopardize that.

From what I understand, most common agent fraud is to just take someone's premium money, print the policy, then cancel it. Agents go to jail for doing that.

Is Russia or the US building new nuclear weapons?  No.

Yeah, and no country in the world is currently expanding their nuclear program.

If you think a limited excursion a mere 100 km from Russian soil to a region that holds three major Russian military bases on 35 year leases during a transitional government is a major offensive, I don't know what to say but you obviously have no idea how limited Russian force projection is nowadays.  

They have about the same abilities as the UK.

This is not a cold war, no one is going to ramp up military production because of this.  Russia can't even afford to.

science,"&gt;  And, after marriage (in general, and this obviously doesn't pertain to everyone), many of the men will ""let loose""

I'm married and have let myself go.   I think a lot has to do with the choices I make. Every time I spend time on myself, I feel guilty not doing things with my wife and kid.  I actually enjoy spending time with my kids a lot.   100 times over I'd rather go on a very low impact bike ride with my kids than go on a bike ride for myself. 

It's unfortunate that it's affected my body, but the time where my kids want to spend time with me is going to wane, so I want to enjoy the time they want to spend with me right now.

I feel that if I don't spend time with them and focus on myself, I'm being selfish."
iama,"First of all, I'm super sorry that you have to go through that. As you can see below, I'm married. But relationships/friendships have always been tough to hold onto. It's easy to question your own self worth when people don't want to have anything to do with you, just for being sick. 

When I was waiting on my genetic testing, it felt like an eternity and the horror of it all was a heavy weight. Just keep reminding yourself that you're here now and that whatever happens, there's always something positive to be found in the mess. Like Dumbledore said, ""Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light."" "
iama,"&gt; Most sensible people would want nothing to do with such an instrument of death particularly following such a tragic event. 

Are you trolling or actually delusional?  Firearms are instruments of high-velocity projectile shooting.  Death only happens when a person uses them to kill another person.  For the vast majority of firearms, this never happens.  

If you seriously look at the massive sporting/target shooting community, the hunters, the collectors, and all the other peaceful gun owners, and call them *mentally ill* and their tools instruments of death, you're being willfully ignorant.  "
iama,"Hi! 

Usually, some foundations help us get basic funds for one or two workshops, or a series of workshops, such as our last one that was sponsored by UNESCO. 

But for the project to be ongoing, we will have fees (which will be considerably cheap) after the first one and a half years (because if we raise all money we need from the campaign, we'll be able to especially help kids who cannot pay fees at all). Also, schools, orgs, and big philanthropists can pay for the fees of students in especially vulnerable areas. Foundations will usually pay all fees for Syrian refugees. 

The idea behind the fee is to give the project a sense of formality (so parents won't tell their kids to pass the workshop ""because it's free"") and maintain money for future projects. "
iama,"Hello i am a 27 year old guy from Sweden and I am considering applying for a program in computer game development (3 year bachelor) and i was wondering if you think of that decision is wise or if i should just try my hand at a more generic computer science program. I don't really want to work with anything else but games in that field so taking a broader program would maybe be a waste of time because i'd be learning a lot of stuff i don't need.

I guess what i'm asking is: Should i bottleneck myself into game development or should i go for the more broader education even though i am not interested in half the stuff i'm learning in that program."

Also, there is such a thing as bad publicity, especially in the space industry. With Mars One sending people on a one way trip to be on a reality show on Mars, stuff is going to go down and they're going to televise the people they sent to Mars dying off one by one. And any failure will be well known. None of that looks good."
science,"What about the health effects on human consumption? I am in no way educated on the subject matter, but doesn't eating an animal that has ate GM crops effect us? Are they passing along some new genetic code that changes our bodies?

Do you think all this GM talk was to create an organic food industry? So they could charge consumers more money. I prefer organic food, it tastes better, well my brain tells me it does. American's are fat enough as it is, we don't really need factory farming. The majority of the American mental state is more more more, it is disgusting.

worldnews,"Funny story, Uncle Joe had a daughter, she later became known as Svetlana Alliluyeva, and she died in the US.

Stalin found out that his only daughter was dating a filmmaker, and a Jewish one at that, at 16.  Stalin was not a vicious anti-Semite (he had Jewish friends, *hic*), but he had anti-Semitic tendencies, to say the least.  Her paramour actually *was* sent to the GULAG for 10 years.  That was one way to break up the relationship.  Needless to say, old Svet and her father were not terribly close before that, and less so after that.  

She ended up marrying, and divorcing, two men whilst Stalin was still alive.  Both of them seem to have survived.  

She was, far and away, the least fucked up of Stalin's children."

iama,"Probably house fires. A couple kids (sober) just died in a really bad car crash up the road from my office, but it was covered by a subsidiary since it's the next town over. My roommate (graduated from the same college, same writing program) is a freelancer for that paper and they made him go to the vigil, and since he couldn't ask anyone their name because they were all in hysterics he had to stalk a dead kid's facebook page, as well as his girlfriend's, to ID the speakers. It's weird how invasive we have to be for fairly trivial details, and how often people get uncomfortable (understandably)."
iama,"We have designed a special program for that called ""The Science League"", which works as a badge system (kinda pokemon-ish). Kids aged 6-18 will have to do after school projects to earn certain badges. Each project can take up to a month with our volunteers meeting them each Saturday. They can do as many projects as they want every year, and to level up they will have to do a science project and present it at our org's annual science festival. 

These extra-curriculum experiments and projects will teach kids how to plan, work in teams, and use theoretical ideas practically. All hands on, all fun. 

And to make sure we are having a good impact, students can stay in the program throughout their school life, and after the age of 18, they can join us as volunteers. "
worldnews,"Social change occurs only from a grassroots level. This is true in democracy, dictatorship, and theocracy, as in all three social change is likely responsible for overwhelming a majority opinion.

An excellent example is the civil rights movement in America. It only succeeded after a social movement usurped the majority and thus gained popular support.

The only way that a social movement occurs is through pressure. As humanists (if you agree with the equality of humanity, that is), we are just and in fact obligated to apply pressure towards social movement."
iama,"How did you get diagnosed? Was it a family doctor or did you go to the hospital and requested for a specific exam? Either way, how long did it take for you in order to get diagnosed? 

How did you approach the doctor? I've actually asked a generalist doctor before and he just seemed to brush it off by saying ""well, some people are smaller than others and it has a lot to do with genetics"".

Also, what pushed you to start treatment today, instead of let's say, 4 years ago.. or 2 years from now?

Thanks for the answers!"
science,"Hello Dr. Shepherd! I am currently studying in Neurobiology and find the brain fascinating. The fact our brain controls our entire perception of reality and is able to make thoughts before we are aware of them utterly astounds me. I have so many questions I could ask, but I all try to keep it in your field of study. 

Pertaining to your work in Alzheimer's disease how exactly could we potentially reverse neuronal degeneration or prevent it? Such a thing seems nigh impossible and i'm curious as to how far medicine has progressed into looking for a cure and plausible treatments. "
iama,"I think there's not much ""need"" for social media on a daily basis.  But I have found it to be the best resource in times of emergency.  We had a flood in my area back in 2009.  Some streets were flooded, others were passable.  The area is so huge that the news couldn't broadcast details on the condition of every single road.  So people were sending out their experience with local roads over Twitter.  I was able to keep coworkers very well informed of the situation just by refreshing the hashtag for the flood that people were using.  Then a Facebook page really helped out a lot of people in a more recent emergency.  

So, like any kind of technology, social media is just a tool.  Its worth is in how people use it."
science,"It is related. If I found no discernible difference in health between rats fed bleach laced food and arsenic laced food, I couldn't very well claim that the bleach on your lettuce has ""no effect"" on your health. Which is what this study is intended to imply.

We already know that a corn diet is much worse for the cow's health than a grass one. The argument that this needs to be compared to a _healthy_ baseline is not invalid.

The fact that these studies are performed so counter intuitively (I almost want to say deceptively) is what leaves me so skeptical to begin with. Why in the hell _not_ just do it the _right_ way??"

First, it really doesn't feel like a doc, it feels closer to a film in many ways, not much in the way of talking heads and approximate b roll.

Second, frankly, it is tough to get a doc seen by many people as a doc if that makes sense, and we want people to see this film.

Especially if there are highly conserved gene sequences present across many viral species. RNA interference is still fringe science though, so there could be other mechanisms by which negative side effects could occur. Viruses are also capable of rapid adaption to antiviral therapies, which may limit the effectiveness of this treatment somewhat."

And that's because there's no point having a gang to sell tobacco when anyone can just *buy it at a store.* Which they can do precisely because it's legal.

iama,"Not saying it doesn't happen (cause it does), but only very foolhardy farmers don't rotate their crops (grow different crops in the same field in a rotation cycle). Planting the same crop in a field year after year - even if they are different cultivars/varieties - leads to massive buildup of disease inoculum in that field. A lot of pathogens overwinter in the soil and in plant debris. Coupled with the rise in no-till agriculture, this basically means that after the second year a farmer would be spending a lot of time, money, and pesticides to try and keep that pathogen population under control. At the risk of taking a massive hit in yield.

Most farmers follow integrated pest management (IPM) best practices. One of the cornerstone practices of a solid IPM program is having a solid crop rotation."

iama,I was forced to read your book Nickel and Dimed in college and found it to be nothing but self serving literature that was obviously meant to be featured on day time talk shows and guilt middle aged well off white women into buying so they could tell their suburban peers just how in touch they are with the plight of the working class poor. Your obvious disdain and condescending pity you took on these people was shameful. And the tone you took in your writing shows that you were interested in putting these people on display so that you could sell books. Only white middle class guilt keeps this trash on the shelves.

I completely agree it's unacceptable that they face any repercussions, but the religion doesn't promote that. Men have taken it upon themselves to behave in that way. It shouldn't be allowed to happen. But let's not kid ourselves in the fact that in every religion and culture women are pressured by men to do things. It's not necessarily a religious issue. It's that plenty of men believe they can get away with things they shouldn't "
iama,"I'm a huge fan Mr Gatiss, I've grown up on your work - can't believe you're doing an AMA!

Who is your favourite character from LoG? To play or to write? I really enjoyed the progression of Pauline, her pens and Micky personally.

Also, my favourite series by far is the third (that season is one of the best things to ever be broadcast on television, how everything tied together...) - but which is your favourite? Why?

And finally, I really enjoyed your documentary on horror films and their influence on you - it really did change the way I looked at Hammer Horror films. Could you see yourself doing a similar project again? Or did you do the horror documentary as its a subject so close to your heart?

p.s. the way you quote 'looks like it had been suckled' occasionally haunts my dreams"
science,"Sigh. 

What if I told you that heterozygous hybrids have been in use for decades before GMOs (Referring transgenic and more modern varieties) existed? Hybrids whose offspring do not retain the same level of desirable traits? 

What if I told you that farmers just buy more seed every year to save the hassle of harvesting it from the crop? 

What if I told you that there's literally no way around preventing reseeding other than charging an order of magnitude more for the purchase of these biotech crops, sine the company has to return their investment somehow, and now it has to be all at once instead of per annum of usage. This marks a huge barrier to entry to smaller farms and tips the playing field toward mega farms or just larger entities who can afford to produce that much capital, leaving small businesses to take out massive loans or be outcompeted by better products. "
iama,"They're not patenting ""seeds"" as a whole. They're patenting the particular modification made. Seeds from an unmodified strain will not be covered by that patent, nor would they be patentable in the first place unless there was a clear intentional modification created. You can't just pick some wild seeds and patent them. What would you even be patenting? That's absolutely not how the patent system works. 

I get that this is a big issue in the anti-GMO world, but the lack of understanding that comes with such a position is worrying. "

I recently started working in TV/movies (infact I work at a large post prod place in Canada that does some of your stuff was lucky enough to see swearnet and some of season 8 prior to its release) and im really curious as to how a tv show with a shoe string budget becomes a cultural phenomenon like yours...

science,"I gave you a VERY simple outline of how the regulatory process worked. I have a very good understanding of how the regulatory approvals systems work because that's an integral part of what I have been doing for the past several years of my life.

FDA requires that all products be safe for human consumption. That's a requirement all biotech products must meet. FDA offers a voluntary consultation process to ensure all products meet this standard. All companies have utilized this voluntary process.


&gt;Are you sure about this? My understanding is that individual GMOs are left 'self regulated' and that the gov really only sets standards on procedure and the like, not really doing any individual assessment of individual GMOs, but I'm not 100% on that. Please correct me if that's wrong.

I am dead sure. Don't believe me? Go to the APHIS site. http://www.aphis.usda.gov/

Were only on the 3rd generation of Kim and that country is already irrecoverably fucked up. Did I mention Assad's use of chemical weapons to purge minorities?

Elite athletes may have better lifestyle habits than the general population after they retire. Elite athletes may have more money than the general population. Elite athletes have better social standing than most of the general population. Elite athletes have better genetics than the general population. Elite athletes tend to be more symmetrical, suggesting that elite athletes have better prenatal environments. Elite athletes have less chronic stress for much of their lives. Elite athletes need to eat well and sleep well for their professions, whereas most other professions may demand sacrifices in both of these. 

It must be pretty good being an elite athlete."
iama,There is really no channels for a mechanic to input to Boeing on the designs of their aircraft.  I am sure Boeing engineers consult with their mechanics or liaisons in the design of new airframes. Over the years the later series of aircraft they produced you can find marked improvements.  For example on the Boeing 737-300 classic there are brake valves installed in precarious places in the main wheel well making maintenance on these difficult.  But on the next generation 737 they are placed in the wide open and easily accessed.

science,"Respectfully, you're mistaken. 


The counterintuitive increase in the 'birthday problem' derives from the the probability no longer being n/365 as when you compare a group to a specific date looking for a match. Rather it's that each person is being compared to each other person in the group so your chance of a 'match' increases factorially by n. I think the probability function is something like p(match) = 1 - p(n)-p(n-1)...etc until n=1.

The bible seems to be way more accurate than any history book I was taught that told me Columbus discovered America but failed to tell me who discovered Europe.

Okay, I lied, two questions!

I've only got the most cursory knowledge on the virus, but is Epstein-Barr linked to only certain kinds of cancers or is it more widespread, meaning could the skin cancer on his head have developed in tandem with the EBV in his lungs?

But seriously though, I'm not the one pushing for a subjective, ideologically motivated version of science (like creationists or materialists); I'm pushing for an objective, ideologically-neutral stance (like intelligent design, which *is* neutral because it seeks only to empirically detect design, not to speculate as to the designer). At the very least, we need to allow for critical thinking with regard to science.

science,"This is certainly a pertinent topic right now. There are fairly good studies both in humans and in animals showing that chronic use of marijuana, ESPECIALLY in adolescents can lead to cognitive decline especially in working memory. Whether this is also applicable to adults who chronically smoke, it's less clear. Legalizing the drug has pros and cons, which is for another day/debate but I worry that increased access to the drug in teenagers will have long term consequences...let alone the fact that smoking is just bad for you in general. I just think we don't know enough about exactly how chronic use will affect cognition. Scientists also need to figure out how much intake is bad or will lead to permanent effects. 

Someone asked about alcohol consumption. Chronic alcoholism is extremely bad for the brain, causing all sorts of damage. It's unclear what moderate alcohol intake does...most studies that look at this are not well controlled. "
iama,"Hello Mr Bridges. Several years ago before the second Tron movie came out I had a passing thought that I've always wanted to share with you. It occurred to me that perhaps The Dude was actually Kevin Flynn and that going inside the computer had blown his mind so hard that he took all his video game money, moved to L.A. and spent all his time smoking pot, drinking White Russians and doing whatever he could to avoid anything to do with modern technology. And bowling. 

So my question is, who do you and what would The Dude and Flynn make of my (ridiculous stoner) idea?

P.S. Thank you for existing, you've long been one of my all-time favorite actors. "
todayilearned,"TIL that Inquisition was first founded in France, in 1184, and was ""exported"" to Spain in 1249. Why is it called Spanish Inquisition and not French Inquisition? 
They established Inquisition in order to fight  Catharism, an heresy. One of the first famous Inquisitors, Arnald Amalric, established Inquisition's tolerance standards (ironic) at Beziers siege. When the military chief asked him how to distinguish heretic citizens from the law abiding ones, the Inquisitor said: ""Kill them all. For the Lord knoweth them that are His""."

- New Dwarf Planet Found At The Solar System's Outer Limits  Scientists have spotted a new dwarf planet at the edge of our solar system.



- Figuring out what lies in this part of our solar system should provide clues to help astronomers understand how our solar system formed, says Meg Schwamb, an astronomer at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan.



- ""For short we've just been calling it VP, or sometimes we even just call it Biden,"" Sheppard says.



- Until now, the only object detected in that part of our solar system was a dwarf planet called Sedna, after an Inuit goddess said to live in the frigid Arctic Ocean.



- He and Scott Sheppard, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., have spotted another dwarf planet that stays even farther out than Sedna.

iama,"Thanks for your question /u/Clearlydontcare! 

That is the case with most of the Armenian men, but not all of them. 

Let me tell you from my personal experience. I had this girlfriend a few years ago, when I was still in Iran. I was not controlling at all. I let her do what she wanted and never asked her about who she was texting, talking to, going out with, etc.
So after around 6 months, she told me about a boy she was texting for a while, but I wasn't worried as I trusted her and I was sure that she wouldn't cheat on me. On a beautiful day, she told me that she doesn't love me anymore, and can't lie to me about it. I was very disappointed and told her to go with the other guy, if she loves him more. In contrast the other guy was extremely controlling and didn't let her even come close to me. Although, she broke up with him eventually, but I figured that she liked his behavior better than mine. "

todayilearned,"Fact: the drug laws create a black market, forcing an artificial supply shortage and pushing the price of drugs up. There will always be a demand for drugs, regardless of whether they are illegal or not.

Fact: drugs are associated with gangs because the black market makes selling drugs profitable. Gangs operate outside the law, and will sell drugs regardless of the law if there is a large enough profit incentive. Drugs fund gangs.

If drugs were legal, would it be possible for gangs to sell drugs for profit, fueling their violence? Nope. To blame drugs for the violence is misguided. Illegal drugs allow gangs to exist. Without drug laws, there are no gangs and without gangs there is no violence.

science,"Hi u/CompMolNeuro  

 I think you might be thinking of HPV (human papillomavirus) rather than HSV.  

Certain serotypes of HPV are linked to cervical cancer (and other cancers of the ano/genital region) and, increasingly, to head and neck cancer.  But early data from Australia suggests that the recently introduced HPV vaccine is decreasing the incidence of cervical abnormalities caused by HPV (suggesting the HPV vaccine is giving protection).  

Our EBV vaccine is designed to treat patients, but other groups (and ourselves) are working on a preventative EBV vaccine that in the long term could similarly prevent infection with the virus.  That’s something for a future AMA perhaps!"

2) Green peppers, Cauliflower, and potatoes all have Nicotine in them. 

You are sitting here saying ""they produced a tobacco tomato"" when the reality is tomatos are amongst the vegetables which already produce nicotine. They simply bred them to make higher levels of the stuff.

You register at usahockey.com and pay a fee of course. You then go to a 1 day long (6 hours or so) seminar at a local ice rink. Then you take an open book 50 question test. You must get 40/50 correct.

The higher levels you go, the harder the test becomes and it isn't open book anymore.

The governing body is called USA Hockey and their relationship is nothing more than making decisions on the rules and ruling over suspensions and immoral behavior. USA Hockey both governs the leagues and referees. Some districts (I ref in the Mid American district) can have special rules over things like mouth guards, other equipment, petty little rules that never come up and other small matters."
science,"There is some research being done into Chronic Fatigue, but it's unfortunately not as much as there should be. It seems like a lot of doctors are biased towards things that they know of and that they know are treatable, and there aren't many that are willing to go forward with research and such. As far as i know, there are only about 5 doctors nationwide that are actively doing research into the subject. At least something is being done? 
This is a non-profit organization out of Utah called OFFER http://www.offerutah.org/
that fortunately is actively doing research. I was lucky enough to get into the doctor, Lucinda Bateman's office and i have been doing so much better since."
iama,"I can understand your original point, but i think the biggest benefit to this is that these Koreans are getting to interact with ""the enemy"" for extended periods of time and by doing so they may eventually start to see them as not that. 

You have to remember that the vast majority of them are indoctrinated from birth that the outside world is a terrible place to live, much worse than what they have to deal with on a daily basis, and if this guy has even the slightest chance of changing the minds of some of them, then i don't have a problem with them doing this. 

The *people* of North Korea are the ones that are going to be the ones to bring change to the country. "
askreddit,Stop with the bullshit about American Exceptionalism list the superpowers and there is one country on the list (not for long). I just thought it would be important for people to know that countries history because it explains why the U.S. is the way it is and no country has more influence today than the US. You can't really dispute this. Yea we learned about the Australians involvement though we focused more on your contributions to WWII like your Air Force on D-Day. We also had to learn about the stolen generations along with the gold rush. Not much else though. Looking back we actually learned quite a bit about the stolen generations and the Protection Act of '69 (easy to remember 69 for high schoolers). American's history classes love to look around and really drill in the racism=bad concept. 
worldnews,"Interesting the ""Elon Musk"" is an anagram for ""Omen Sulk"". Odd business, worrying about something that has no practical value and which would be a deeply inhumane thing to develop.

Distributed soft AI, whereby companies and other organisations become transpersonally optimised: ""you two should talk or there will eb a misunderstanding in a month or so.""

iama,"Hey! That's a very good question. The first story that came to mind was [the one I did](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/06/mass-shootings-arent-on-the-rise.html) on James Alan Fox's claim that mass shootings aren't on the rise in the U.S. I think as journalists/editors we have a natural sweet tooth for stories that run counter to established ""common-sense"" narratives, and this was a prime example.

In this particular case, I actually wish I'd included a bit more nuance. Fox knows what he's doing and is a respected criminologist, but there's slightly more controversy to this issue than my piece indicated (Google his name and Mother Jones if you're interested), partly because mass shootings are a surprisingly difficult thing to measure. -JS"
iama,"Hes saying toasted, he means heated.  If you don't get the chicken, steak, bacon, ect toasted, then it goes in the microwave.  Its no big deal to do so, but when you have a line to the door it kinda messes up the rhythm of the line and also I have to worry if the idiot at the end of the line is going to remember to take your meat out and put it on the sub. Edit:It isn't a food safety issue, Subway just wants those meats to be served hot 100% of the time, as that is how they were intended to be served.  If you want it cold thats fine just ask.

Personally as a Subway employee for going on 4 years, the only thing I hate making is pizzas."
todayilearned,"Yeah, this really shouldn't be the mentality. I think we need to focus on building a better, more cohesive society that collectively says ""if your life is better spent to you by receiving some meager handout, then you can live off us. But we all value our lives based on how we can contribute to one another, and hope you feel the same to the extent that we will offer everything we can to help you become a valuable and contributing member of society. We hope you join us, and look forward to seeing what you have to offer."" Otherwise, you're just shaming people for accepting the benefits program put in place specifically to help them.

And if your society is one where everyone is constantly trying to fuck over everyone else, you have bigger problems that ""a few people are lazy and might contribute to a free-rider problem."" "

science,"I'm 6'4"", lift aggressively, and currently weigh just under 100kg (220lbs). Normal people -- that is, people outside of competitive weightlifting -- see me as relatively muscular. My BF% is probably around 18% to 20% right now. You cannot see my abs.

Sorry, but as someone who lifts, I know what someone who is 6'5"" and 100kg looks like, and how jacked he would have to be in order to have abs that show. Post a picture, why don't you. Because I don't believe it, unless you really *are* ""top-tier of fitness"" (and probably juicing, to boot).

But you know, even if on the off chance you were able to deliver on 
that picture request -- I know you won't, but humor me -- you would still be so unusual that no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from you."
science,"The guild system was one of the casualties of the Black Plague, though it did take some time. The article doesn't imply an overnight change, but over a couple of generations (from my understanding in other readings) the guild system lost much of its rigidity, out of necessity. 

The cooks guild, in your example, being short on cooks, was more likely to ignore traditional requirements and welcome willing labor. Market forces favored relaxing the rules, and a locale where they were not relaxed placed itself at a disadvantage to other competing areas. The rise and decline of local economies according to their policies can be seen from a market-driven Darwinian perspective. "
iama,"LOL...no, actually it wouldn't.  You would be complaining about us following protocol, so that wouldn't make us look bad.  Also, my boss actually did value his employees and treated us with respect.  And, in fact, asked a few customers not to come back based on how they treated one of us.  So, sorry to burst your bubble, but not everyone in America is willing to demean their employees for someone to purchase a $5 sandwich with 3 pieces of onion.

Most Subways probably don't, but if their boss is there, or if they are getting an inspection, or if they are new and just trying to follow the rules, it could happen.  They don't do it out of spite, they do it trying to do their job the right way.  "
iama,"Its not terribly often...once every 6 months or so.   The most recent was a woman tried started a zoo in the city 15 years ago and her request was denied.  We did not know but she kept four monkeys inside her home the entire time.  She lived in a populated area too!  We never knew until Fedex delivered a package and saw them in the garage each staring out a window at him.  We impounded them but returned them to a location of her choosing outside the county.  In our state, exotic animals are limited by county.  Most counties don't have rules against it"
todayilearned,"That is an opinion, first of all. But I guess its fair, because I was implying I think it is worse.

I just think TWBB has a more literary tone, and more high-brow themes. No Country is a great movie that is certainly far more gripping than TWBB throughout, especially in its pacing. But I don't think it has the same thematic depth. 

And I also think TWBB has more complex characters qua characters, and better individual performances (DDL &amp; the preacher especially).

That said, we watch movies for different reasons, and I am willing to admit No Country excelled in certain areas (especially the pacing and just generally being a gripping film).

To be honest, where I'm coming from is a judgment of McCarthy as a writer. Among McCarthy's books, I consider NCfOM one of his less-complex works. Maybe that informed my judgment of the film. 

Idk, what do you think?"
iama,"Hey Jeff.

Not going to lie, I'm a huge fan of The Giver and haven't really seen many of your other movies, though I'm going to start watching them now. Three questions:

1. What were some of the ""hard decisions"" you had to make while doing the movie. ""IE, this will be hard to do, but we cannot leave it out because it is too critical to the story.""
2. I know that some of the characters will play larger roles in the movie than the book (Asher, The Female Elder, Fiona), but what are some of the other differences between the movie and book.
3. When will you start on the other three books/sequels and how much do I have to pay you to have a cameo?

science,"Unpopular opinion here. The main argument on the pro-GMO side of things seems to be the concept that GMO's can feed more people. My question is why do we want more people populating this seemingly dying planet? I would rather stricter policy on the GMO crop industry like looser patent laws and lax to no penalties for farmers who may have GMO crops on there land that weren't purchased.  Also consumers should have detailed labels on everything they buy. Last but not least farmers should not be able to inject antibiotics, steroids and feed animals foods they shouldnt naturally be eating without labeling what they have been doing. Cows should be eating grass and studies show cows that ea grass are healthier for human consumption. Im not for banning GMO's or corn fed beef I just want to know as a consumer whats in the products I buy. Also I dont believe its our interest to feed a ever growing human overpopulated ecosystem. "
iama,"Where someone is from tends to matter very little. Race, social status, etc. doesn't mean much. But here are some of my personal experiences:
* People who love reading tend to have an easier time visualizing (and can go deeper).

* Creative people tend to be more likely to experience the more intense effects.

* Intelligence doesn't matter as much as you'd think, as long as someone is capable of understanding on a subconscious level what the hypnotist is doing.

* Culture matters *very* little for hypnosis itself, but much more for the effects of it. For example, Japanese people get more upset by not being able to remember their name than American people, because 'stupidity' in their culture is seen as a serious blemish."

todayilearned,"Check out the concept of a ""glass hallway."" Rather than the ""glass ceiling"" that existed some decades ago where women were sparce in the C-level and SVP ranks, we now have the glass hallway, where people (often women) have a high-status position but no realistic chance at being promoted into the CEO spot. Most CEOs come from operations, finance, or technical backgrounds... HR just isn't a good primer for the corner office. 

It's nice to see progress in diversification, but let's not ignore the idea that women are still being marginalized in senior corporate management, just more subtly than in the past. "
iama,"Can you enable an option to **not** use the pop up window for composing a reply or new mail?  I absolutely hate not being able to use a full window for writing an e-mail, especially since this is how it will be viewed anyway (at least in a desktop browser or e-mail program).

The tiny mobile-sized window should absolutely not be the default on the browser (or should at least be an option to turn off), and right now there is only a button to pop it out, not to return to full screen.

science,"I'm a pharmacy student, and I've been learning a lot about bacterial evolution towards antibiotic resistance. My question is, if a certain antibiotic has become obsolete (methicillin for example) and isn't used for 50 or so years, will the bacteria ""forget"" it's immunity? It seems as though creating enzymes for antibiotic protection consumes energy. If it was creating this immunity with no purpose, the ones who weren't doing that would be at an advantage, able to more quickly reproduce? Methicillin might be a bad example since there are still beta lactams being used, but if we were to stop using all beta lactams for years?"

science,"You're missing the point. What /u/Love_Bulletz means is that all of our crops are modified genetically from their ""natural"" counterparts. Now for most of our history this was done using artificial selection, but it was then done for a while using X-rays to cause random mutations during the 1920s. Now all of a sudden when we can introduce exactly what we want it's suddenly not OK? Why? It's essentially the same thing but using quicker and more refined techniques. Arguably, modern methods of genetic modification are *less* likely to have unwanted side effects than older methods."
science,"The United States definitely takes the bulk of the blame for almost everything that's wrong these days, no matter what the problem is. But if someone were to do a few hours of research detailing what all countries have done to help or hurt modern society, I'd be willing to bet they would have a MUCH better out look on the US and honestly would probably go about their criticism in a much more humble manner. People tend to forget what and who the US is made of historically and have completely taken everything this country has done for the world for granted. If you deleted the US and everything contributed by us in history, the world wouldn't be nearly as complete. This sounds completely biased and bigoted but it is true regardless of how you feel about it."
worldnews,"&gt;I don't understand the circle jerk making fun of CNN for giving it as much air time as it did.

Because much of the time they had nothing to report. For days/weeks at a time there was little to no new information and they had 'experts' in discussing every possibility from hijacking and taking the plane to Iran/Iraq/Syria/etc; to black holes and aliens. Not to mention all the shots of the grieving families and sob stories about the people on board.

It vanishing was a pretty big deal, but the likely story is that the crew lost pressure/oxygen at some point in the air and in the confusion from the lack of air turned the autopilot to a different heading, where it flew until it was out of fuel. Similar to what happened to [Helios Flight 522](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_Airways_Flight_522). Except there is little radar coverage/surveillance over where MH370 went missing because it's mostly ocean, so there was nothing out there so see the plane's final hours. "
iama,"It's different there then it is here. Here we use the blend for ""nitro"" pours and pure co2 for regular draught beer. The beer is carbonated in the keg and kept at a low psi which both maintains the carbonation and pushes the beer through the line. The specific pressure is based on the length and diameter of the line and the temperature of the beer. You can change any of those three variables to get a proper pour. It's rare to see hand-pumped beers with the exception of high end beer bars that do them on special occasions or places that try to feel ""more British"" (and then it's usually an old firkin of speckled hen that tastes like crap.)

Is there any hope of a vaccine against the initial viral infection? That would prevent cancers caused by EBV and also stop all of these terrible cases of mononucleosis in adults.

It seems like mono has an image problem. Some people still jokingly call it the ""kissing disease"" and think of it as something that affects only kids. It is great that you are doing this AMA and spreading the word that EBV can have serious health consequences."

The wealthy have access to deductions, capital gains tax rates, and off shore tax shelters. The total wealth that they gain in a year is taxed far lower than it would be if it were considered income. When you say that the wealthy pay higher tax rates and then only consider the small portion of their earnings that are subject to high tax rates (taxes on income) then you are being disingenuous and misleading, and you are confusing the semantics of what it means to ""pay taxes."" You are taking one small portion of their tax burden (income) and then extrapolating that to say that the tax rate on all their gains is at that same rate, which is completely false. Bill Gates has paid $6billion in taxes, which is only about 10% of how much he has gained in his career. Mitt Romney is in the same boat on his tax rate. "

I'm not sure extensively covering it would be age appropriate given at that pre widespread internet time, knowledge of sex itself was limited for 12/13 year olds). 

I will say that they should do a better job with it. They cover it rather dryly more from a universal pacifist stance than a ""we done fucked up"" stance.

2) The causative argument being made by the study (which is entirely different from what the article here is trying to say it is) is done with a modeling study where cause and effect can be examined in more detail than looking at the historical record, although the results are compared to the historical record for the sake of completeness. "
science,"A more apt comparison would be bleach laced food vs. food laced with both bleach and arsenic (obviously in quantities that won't straight up kill everything, because that's clearly not happening in the current feed situation). 

In that case the opposite result of this study would have been found, that the cows were overall more sick on the latter diet than the former.

The argument for a ""healthy"" baseline is absolutely irrelevant because the appropriate control for a study in which genetic modification is the independent variable being studied would be the non-modified version of the exact same feed.

If one were to do a study of GMO corn vs. other feed it would be impossible to accurately determine whether or not any difference in health was attributable to the different grass species or to the genetic modification."
worldnews,"You're correct on Sudan, I missed it. 

All listed speak variants of Arabic language, their culture has heavy Arabic influence (beyond just being Muslim), and many self-identify as Arabs. 

Of course, every country has a specific mix of ethnicities, you'll hardly find a pure one anywhere. BTW, the Copts you mentioned are an Orthodox Christian minority.

However, contrary to Egypt, Libya and co, it is obvious that Turks and Iranians are *not* Arabic. Different language, entirely different ethnic origins and they don't even self-identify as Arabs (in case of Iran rather forcefully denying it). "

science,Did you read the paper? they dissected the eyes of the shrimp and created a imaging processor that polarizes light directly into the imaging sensor. What's really cool is that the mantis shrimp has one eye polarized one direction (horizontal)  and one another direction (vertical) this is kinda how 3d glasses kinda work and they do this in their own eyes. This would give them superb vision underwater and excessively sunny areas. Doing this with digital photography allows them to have unexpected and in this case greatly useful applications. 
iama,"Peter: Nudibranch! I discussed these little buggers in [my last AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2i6tcr/iama_underwater_archaeologist_want_to_learn_about/) on underwater research. Nudibranch are aquatic critters that divers often see. They are tiny and delicate, but beautifully colored creatures. 

But there are lots of beautiful creatures. What makes nudibranchs my favorite is their mating ritual. All nudibranchs are hermaphrodites, so they have both male and female organs. When a nudibranch happens upon another nudibranch, they pull out their penises and battle. The winner of the sword fight gets to be the male and the loser acts as the female, eventually laying eggs in a cool [spiral formation](http://reefseekers.com/PIXPAGES/Socal%20\(general\)/Nudibranch_egg_sac.jpg). 

I have yet to see a nudibranch sword fight live, but I keep an eye out on every dive :)

People here act like rape, conquest and mutilation would be seen as barbaric in the 15th and 16th centuries as they are today. This isn't true. You give a man in the 15th century a source of wealth, power and pleasure that offers no resistance to being taken, he WILL take it, others will not look down on him for it unless they were unusually kind for the time (see: Bartolomé). Though I will admit that giving a man such power over the natives would inevitably lead to more cruelty. That is not unique to Columbus though. There was a social experiment done where perfectly normal people were given the roles of guards and prisoners. The guards grew to be monsters. more details [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment).

Colonisation was also essential to get to the **civilised** world we have today. Peaceful coexistence is a naive and stupid idea that would never be feasible and would only halt progress."
science,"I think one of the most exciting new areas is in the realm of genetics. It has become so cheap to sequence people's genomes that large studies can now be conducted to look for the genetic contribution to common neurological disorders. Identifying these genes is not only very useful to scientists who want to understand the proteins that may not be working correctly...but it will also allow Doctors in the future to tailor treatments. This has revolutionized Cancer treatment, for example, because some drugs work very well on cancers causesd by certain mutations. Right now we have been limited to diagnosing brain disorders purely on symptoms alone. "

todayilearned,"Basically Ramanujan summation is a technique for computing real-number answers to infinite sums. If you take the sum of all natural numbers, for example, that's an infinite sum that *diverges.* It just keeps getting bigger no matter how long you watch it. It never *converges* to a real-number answer. Its value at infinity *is* infinity.

But Ramanujan came up with some techniques that essentially break the rules of algebra a little bit (having to do with things like piecewise subtraction of one infinite sum from another), but that allow mathematicians to assign real-number values to these infinite sums which have no meaningful limit of convergence.

That's not to say Ramanujan summation is a parlor trick. It has some specific examples in specific applied-mathematics fields. But to the ordinary man on the street like you or me, yes, Ramanujan summation is just a parlor trick that has no real meaning."

Things like inspectability of certain zones, issues with AMM processes, desired instructions for a frequent repair/servicing task that may be unclear. All this gets discussed and prioritized for the airframer to eventually respond to (via manual updates, service bulletins, etc).

Using translational approaches including tissue engineering and molecular biology, huge advances such as 3D printing, synthetic materials and induced pluripotent stem cells are allowing scientists and engineers to develop pragmatic solutions and to hopefully cure currently incurable diseases. It’s not just a purely biological discipline but involves input from engineers, material scientists and mathematicians. Even with the current advances in regenerative medicine, there are many unanswered questions such as ‘How do we recreate the structure of an organ? How do get enough cells to treat people? How can we make this available for everyone?’ These are some of the questions that we at Loughborough, Keele and Nottingham Universities are trying to solve.

They don't care about certain important conventions, which I cannot elaborate on unfortunately. They are vengeful and manipulative, but still - they're the head of a charity, they're extremely superficially friendly and they are very good at fooling most people into thinking they're listening and caring about what's being said.

And if I do know, then I know enough to know where BMI isn't useful, so it's just shifting my initial critique.

There's modified BMI by frame and that's a little better, but better yet is to focus on body fat percentage. "

&gt;Fun fact: This scene was done in one take. When the German Sniper is hit, the blood/brain spray and the simulation of where his eye used to be are all ""real"", no CG, just prosthetic. The spray itself is raw, bloody meat sprayed backward from an air cannon positioned behind the actor. The blood on his eyelids and eye itself is sort of sticky prosthetic stuck to the inside of the scope shade eye piece. When he puts his eye on it, he presses the prosthetic into place. I don't remember how they faked the glass on the scope shattering, been searching for quite some time for the article I read on it.

science,"Although I don't want to interpret one individual paper *too* broadly, this has huge implications for atmospheric quality models. Generally speaking, you have the meteorology data which is considered to be ""independent variable"", and air quality is sort of the ""dependent variable"" that results from different emissions controls under the given meteorological patterns. (Well actually they're huge matrices of variables often in the terabyte range but you get the idea.) When the meteorology depends on the air quality, it's going to become a huge iterative mess.

...we're going to need bigger supercomputers."

Though, as we dug into it we discovered some severe engineering challenges. Honestly, as you begin to look closely at specific parts it becomes clear why they engineered them and manufactured them the way they did (for the most part).

If 3D printing were a really useful and economical option for car parts right now, the manufacturers would certainly be doing it as they have the most to gain. But the truth is it's not ready yet.

India has modern patent laws and enforcement, but the problem is not modern patent laws (compulsory licensing is part of modern patent laws) and enforcement. It is the medicine price and the average income of the people which matter.

If India manufacturers generics due to compulsory licensing and exports it to South Africa where it can be sold easily due to compulsory licensing in SA too, then you can see that patent laws are enforced. In such situation too, generics would be popular if most of the people in SA cant afford expensive medicines."

It was from this perspective that I was arguing it was Tolkien's love of languages that inspired his dissent more than his strict adherence to ""the way things were""

This seems similar to the deals Obama made to pass the ACA.

And Obama is rightly criticized for his record on civil liberties but of course FDR interned a whole ethnicity in camps.

FDR also abandoned Keynesianism in his 37/38 budget and sent the economy plunging again.  It seems to me he was saved by the military Keynesianism he was forced to pursue due to the US entry into WWII.

There is also imaging where you edit audio in between songs.  For example in between songs there's a quick audio of someone saying the station name, laughter sound effects etc.

Then there is production.  You could be doing more sound editing for commercials.

You could be involved in what we call traffic.  Traffic works with the sales teams and figures out what commercials go where and when they should be scheduled.  

You could be a producer.  This is most often associated with morning shows or talk shows.  The idea is the producer is helping prepare audio, screening callers, editing and splicing audio, etc while the on-air hosts are live.  They will even help with show preparation.

This is the basis of the Paul Bunnell or “monospot” test that, if positive, helps to diagnose the disease. 

It’s still not clear why these “heterologous” antibodies appear because EBV does not share any antigens with sheep red blood cells, but the fact is that the test is a pretty good (but not fool proof) way of diagnosing most cases of IM.  Nevertheless the best diagnosis (not typically used in hospital labs) is to look for rising antibody responses to EBV itself.    "

Normally light isn't polarized, all of the ""waves"" are bouncing in random directions. But some things can filter out the waves that aren't bouncing in a particular direction, that's what we call polarized light.

This is useful in biochemistry because many biologically-produced chemicals polarize light in a specific, quantifiable way, so you can take a sample and shine some light through it and learn something about what's in the sample."

Or maybe the wind carried the seeds.. either way that farmer now has to pay up...

Another inherently bad thing is that the foodstuffs of the world are becoming more like a monoculture and gmo aid in that process.

I guess I struggle to see how a family would decide not to take their kids to Disney world based on the thought process of, ""We as parents could legally buy weed while we're there, that's not going to work.""  Would they be worried about their 8 year old kids somehow coming into possession of a fake ID and buying pot while they're not looking?

Just letting a random person have an automatic weapon, even if he has good intentions, is more dangerous than not.

And gun culture should definitely stop being encouraged. I watched some documentary a long time ago, so I'm not sure whether this is still true, but the guy basically got a gun as a fucking present for making a deposit in a local bank or something crazy like that.

In my country, you are allowed to have a gun if you pass the checks, get the appropriate license, etc. If you want it for self-defence, fun, hunting - you'll almost certainly get it. "

I'm going to say no....however if tensions continue to rise we are going to see more unrest, protests and it is going to force the government to do one of two things.  1.  Kill more citizens.  2.  Address the underlying causes of unrest.  I am guessing that there will be many more killings before we get to a point where our grievances will be address.  Why?  The simple answer is that it is easier to kill people than it is to change the way we are doing things.  A few underlying causes of anger, strive and overall unrest are the same ones they have always been.  Racism, Economics, Distribution of Wealth, Distribution of Power, Social Services or lack thereof.  Both Government and Corporate corruption etc....  We are out of balance.  "

We really try to focus on these issues and if you haven't seen them, you should take a look at the new community agreement templates in the PMEL program.  The most frequent issue that we have seen is the consideration, or lack thereof, of the local political or social climate.  As an example, elections with the influx of a new political party, can drastically affect or halt the progress of a program.  This is just a reality in international development but it helps to have a strong partnership with the community and local NGOs as they can assist in navigating issues like these."

God placed the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden to make that choice possible. After Satan pointed out to Eve that the only way to become like God was to learn the difference between good and evil, and after determining there was no other way, she partook of the fruit. Adam could find no other way to stay with Eve and fulfill the other commandment to ""multiply and replenish the earth"", other than to partake of the fruit as well.

iama,"What's your opinion on the hypothesis that changes in warfare helped cause the bronze age collapse?  Is there any reason why the bronze age civilizations didn't adopt the new weapons and methods of warfare that they were being wiped out with?  If you don't think changes in warfare drove the collapse, why was there such a change in weaponry during this period?  What is the significance of the year 1177?

Sorry for all the question, but I find the bronze age collapse one of the most interesting mysteries in all of history.  Besides your book, are there any others you would suggest on this topic?

I'd try as SOOOOOOON as you see the look in their eye or ANY tell that they may fight to separate them and then distract them with love and attention and then bring them together and reward them for playing in a positive manor.
Also try keeping them separated when people are around simply to avoid the conflict in the first place and then let them come together when you're more trusting of them.

The simple thing you need to do is scold (in anyway you seem fit) the behave you don't want them to show (signs of fighting or fighting) and then simply reward all behavior that is positive. "
todayilearned,"My own anecdotal experience working for contract agencies years ago;

Contract shop that was predominantly male:

* More jobs offered to me
* Higher pay for the jobs they offered
* More willingness to interact once I was signed on
* Quick to fix problems when they arose

Contract shop that was predominantly female:

* Very few contract opportunities
* Incredibly low-balled pay rates
* Unwillingness to negotiate terms
* High turnover of account reps

Maybe as a male I got better treatment from the the first example contract agency, but in a business environment, it seems as though the male contract owners should be the standard others are held to."
iama,"Thanks Peter and Sam. However, if ""most antiquities are laundered onto the legal market"", isn't that an argument for the small size of the illegal trade? The auction market for Egyptian, Classical and Middle Eastern antiquities is something like $50million a year, the majority of which by value have fully listed provenance. Most auction houses also refuse to take Middle Eastern material without a pre 1990 provenance. So where is the material going, if it is leaving the country? 

Unless dealers are spending a lot of money filling their stock in the hope that the market will change, it seems likely that things are not selling, or selling for a tiny fraction of their potential value."

You compare the 10% population to the 90% population and see the differences. That will get you some plausible correlations. Then you do a RCT to see whether EBV is the cause or if it's a non-causal coincidence (e.g. maybe those 10% didn't get EBV for a reason and that reason explains the differences).

The best way to do the RCT is probably indirectly with a vaccine of young, uninfected people because nobody is going to deliberately infect people to do this test."

You don't require voluntary trade for capitalism to function, and you don't require capitalism (ability to own capital via title) for voluntary trade. What interesting is that we have a mixed economy, a mix of both voluntary trade and not voluntary trade. And a mix of private and public ownership. 

China has capitalism but in many cases doesn't have voluntary trade. Same with the soviet union.

What is interesting is that capitalists typically despise markets. Which should be plain to see why. They are for markets when it reduces prices for their business, but against them when it increases competition in their business. "
todayilearned,"So now we are getting somewhere. You're under the impression this started out like any other bank program. It did not, banks had put a lot of effort into locating people for these programs initially. I worked for one back in the day. These were minorities and working poor that often didn't trust 'the system'. They may have been able to afford a small home but they rented because they figured they would be laughed out of a bank. The bank was getting references, making cold calls, and sending originators out to peoples houses. Most loans got denied because they were underwritten properly, the few that went though made it worth it, ergo the incentives.

After a while the banks realized there was little to no oversight of their underwriting and it went down hill from there. So in the same way I don't think a chick with short shorts on in asking for it. I'm not going to say the gov't exacerbated the problem by incentivizing the loans for the bank."

Southwest Africa would be the most likely in this case, of course. There are also other non-tobacco sources of nicotine.

science,"This! The questionable environmental effects of introducing these seeds to nature have to be mentioned. It's toying with nature and bringing foreign flora into different habitats. Japanese Kudzu is an invasive plant in the US that is destroying forests, for example, since no animal eats it here. Now, imagine the unpredictability of bringing in completely new GM species with no origin to any ecosystem. I believe this is a far bigger issue than human health, and needs a continuous amount of research to see if a certain gmo is harmful/neutral/beneficial in a certain ecosystem, and of course, a lot more discussion.

todayilearned,"My Dad fought in the Battle of the Bulge in WW II.  My three brothers were old enough for Viet Nam.  He never spoke about the war, he'd gotten a purple heart and a bronze star.  He did tell my brothers to do anything they could to stay out of it.  He didn't elaborate but he was emphatic.  After he died our Mom showed us a letter he'd written her after the war but before he rotated home.  Of the 200 men in his company 183 were killed or wounded during the 3 weeks of fighting his unit endured.  This was a desperate fight during a severely cold winter. Approximately 19,000 Americans died in a month of beating back the German attack. No wonder he told my brothers to stay out any way they could."
todayilearned,"Socially acceptable is a tad of a stretch. Reefer madness is still a pervasive mentality, though I do see where you're coming from. I wasn't lauding the grey market or dispensaries as the end-all when it comes to distribution, simply pointing out that they exist and for all intents and purposes _pertaining to distribution_ they work. The danger inherent to interacting with a drug dealer is virtually eliminated in those two sales circles. That's a definite plus from going to some stranger's house or meeting them on the streets. That's part of why institutions like methadone clinics exist (again, not saying 'X=Y' or pretending that that system is anything near perfect, but it _certainly_ is cleaner and safer by a noteworthy margin)."

I got a skateboard there (apparently a design from Bob something) that I still own and still can't ride. So thank you for being part of one of my coolest memories!

I eventually met two people who have had babies through Egg Donation, and I also have met someone who's boyfriend was conceived through egg donation.  It's absolutely beautiful, hearing their stories and how much compassion they have for their kids. I don't think I've ever heard a parent convey such a sense of love for their child so openly, as a parent who was once told the idea of being a parent wasn't a possibility. "
iama,"My comment can be taken in a variety of ways, none meant as a slight to Galway, which is a beautiful place as long as the students aren't out celebrating something.

So tourists in Dublin looking for traditional music might be directed to Galway instead of say another pub down the street.  Galway is like a two-hour drive away, so it's sort of a joke."

For instance, they might have put the weight bench and lifter on a force gauge platform to check for inertial forces, or used some other method.

This currently happens right now with farmers and its unfortunate for anyone who is adjacent to these fields as seeds from nearby farms can find their way to adjacent fields. The big seed companies find out their strain of crops is in another farmers field and sue the adjacent farmers. "

I'm not saying the gov't was not part of the process, but it was not part of the fraud that crashed the economy. That's like saying you are a co-conspirator in the crash for having money in the bank when the loans were created. Maybe if the banks were better regulated by the gov't, this would have been caught much earlier. But oddly the bank fought that too."

Patents are intended to encourage innovation by giving the innovater a temporary monopoly on their product, allowing them to (temporarily) charge prices as high as they want as a reward for coming up with something new and useful.  

If paying the fees legally required for use of Monsanto's seeds is enough to drive Indian farmers into bankruptcy and suicide, couldn't they have just ... not bought the seeds in the first place, or switched back to non-patented seeds after they realized it was too expensive to keep paying the usage fees?

In the other direction there was an ancient empire in the middle east for which it is speculated that they collapsed when they lost their access (via trade) to tin - an important component of bronze.  Since they were using so much of it none of the known close sources of tin could have sufficed and so there is speculation that they were getting their tin from England.

*Not in large volumes, but silk shows up in various early dynasty pharaoh's wigs for instance.  Of course it might not have been trade, it might have been gifts from one king to a neighbouring king.

Most wont go so far as to accept human evolution at first, but once you explain that it is not necessarily counter to their belief system they tend to open up.

So, in a way, your partially correct.

India is also export based much like china goods going again mainly to the west. I don't know enough about south africa or brazil's economy to comment but i don't believe their economy are as coupled to the west.

iama,"The best part of climbing Mt. Everest, and any big mountain like Everest, is what you find out about yourself.  Most people never truly know what they're capable of until they stare death in the face, and that's what Everest offers.  There's frozen bodies and people die every year on that mountain, so you never know if you're going to live or die.  So when you make the decision to climb Mt. Everest, you have to make a clear decision in your mind that you might not come back.  And for me, that's living.  I know it sounds twisted, but I get bored with city life.

The story is aimed at Chinese nationals, and incites nationalism against China's ""enemies,"" such as India. China does the same with any country that disagrees with it in any way. It justifies China's aggression against other countries, and distracts the population's attention away from China's massive internal unrest."

Don't you see the gaps in logic of a system where you must prove innocence?  

It is easily abused, especially if the Law Enforcers have *any* motivation to skew the data at all.

I fully grasp the scenario.

The most rational thing you can do is to choose not to make *any* statements to someone with a gun and the law on their side who is allowed to lie to you with the intent to trick you into confessing things.

It is bonkers that ""saying nothing"" can cause you to be looked at as being 'suspicious' in any way.  

Cops can lie to you, lie in court and its legal.  

Its not ""changing your mind"", its ""refusing to talk to the low capacity for higher logic, grunt with boots on the ground"" and instead waiting to talk to someone who isn't working on an arrest Quota by way of fucking up your life."
science,"Actually, it's even cooler than that.  If you could imagine 1 more color, imagine that color mixed with all the colors you already know to make new colors.   Just like how you mix Red and Yellow to get Orange,  imagine Red and &lt;New Color&gt; mixing for your new mixed color.  So each primary color you can detect represents an ""axis"", and so the number of unique color types is a mixture of colors from each axis.

So if your eye can detect ""millions"" of shades now, adding one new color sensor would make that ""tens of millions"" or ""hundreds of millions"" because of color combinations.

Now imagine adding 9 new axes of color."

You simply can't understand categories that well before you have at least understood some concrete categories that are not Set (and how they differ), like groupoids, R-modules, topological spaces, smooth manifolds, schemes...

A better answer is for parents to help their kids with their social skills and identify problem areas that could make them a target. Parents also need to get their kids involved in disciplines that build confidence. Make you kids STRONG, not weak.


Remember, bullies are EVERYWHERE, and they go far beyond school. They can be bosses, other family members...anybody really. Teaching a kid how to handle a bully will go much further than an anti-bullying crusade that will accomplish NOTHING!

This is a convergence of not only computers being able to do the job cheaper (than a min. wage worker), but people actually accepting it as a part of life.

It's not going to be an overnight change (if it was, then it'd make life better), but there is going to be a tipping point at which you have a significant section of the population that are not only unemployed (because they do not have a job) but are unemployable (because there does not exist jobs they can perform with their skillset), and that does have a tendency to cause major societal problems."

science,"But most people buy cars (and phd) with the intention of using them, sometimes you're comfortable where you are though. That doesn't make the car/phd worthless - it may have got you to the comfortable place, it may one day take you to a more comfortable place.

If I drive to the cinema, and get out of the car, the car still has the same value while I'm watching the film. Same with phd, even if all I'm doing is working at McDonald's, the phd still has the same value to me, because it has potential."
iama,"I'm 29 and have an informal diagnosis of kallmans. Highschool sucked until my senior year, when I started taking androgel. I went through a lot of changes quick. I struggled with doing the medication everyday and have been off for too long now. My muscle mass is much smaller than any other male my age and I don't grow facial hair at all. Good news is I don't have to shave everyday. I know what your going through with people always commenting on how young you look it annoys the shit out of me. I went through a lot of embarrassing things in public and became very introverted. What are some of the things that you hate the most about it? And do you have a sense of smell?"
askreddit,"Seriously, the worst day of my life. 12 year old me on my way to meet my dads ol' lady for the first time at an amusement park.

Fast forward, cars parked I'm hustling through the front gates and on to the shitters, lines out the door.... Finally, FINALLY a stall door cracks open and an elderly man walks out and shoots me the weirdest smirk i've ever received. Walk in and there's piss on everything. I get everything cleaned off and undo my belt and **blapp**. Shit my pants before I undo my button. I made it 30+ miles to the park, waited to park in the lot, waited in line to get in, and finally waited for the john. I lost my grip 1.5 seconds before my buns hit the seat. I have no respect for people who piss on the seat and I hope they burn in hell. "
iama,"Hi! In November of 1988 you interviewed my grandfather, Holocaust survivor Leo Bretholz, on your radio show. I remember him telling me you held up his star and said something to the tune of ""so if I were in Europe, I would have to wear one of these.""  
  
I was wondering if you had any memories or recollection at all of the interview. He passed away in March, so it has been great hearing so many people's stories about talking to him.  
  
Of course I am very aware that you have interviewed literally thousands of people, so I obviously won't be surprised if you can't recall one interview you did in the eighties. I just wanted to try. Thanks a lot!"
iama,"The highest monthly benefit is actually over $3000.  You can do this my peaking out.  In retirement, your monthly check amount is based off your highest 35 years of earnings.  So, you would have to hit the peak taxable earnings for all 35 years (That amount is current about $120,000).  But even that would only bring you up to $2,700 a month if you retire at 66.  If you hold off until 70 (the age where your Social Security stops adding value), your check would be slightly over $3000.

TL; DR: Make 6 figures for 35 years then retire at age 70."
science,"Over the last 6 years I have been working with several autistic children developing competition level swim skills, both high and low function.  I've noticed a few things that have been consistent.  A love of movie quotes on some level, social interaction misinterpretation, and a longer than average time to develop new motor skills.  I am more successful through visual or very specific instructions (metaphors are not very helpful).  Are there parts of the brain that are more heavily relied on in autism that may explain this?"
iama,"But it is important to note that most of those seeds are hybrids and will not breed true. 95% of U.S. corn is hybrid, and a slightly smaller percentage is transgenic. It's important to note that most yield gains are because of the robustness of the hybrids used (which may have greater *intrinsic yield*), not because of biotechnology which only accounts for a part of improved *operational yield* (i.e. yield accounted for by prevention of crop loss from Bt toxin killing selected insects or modified shikimate path allowing direct application of herbicides, not by intrinsic yield increasing capabilities)"
askreddit,"I propose a different scenario. Starts out hush-hush but in a world shocker US and Russia and china form a tyrannical land-greedy alliance and through a surprisingly peaceful set of negotiations, over tea and a map, share out the world between them. The whole world is horrified but there exists no nation with even the slightest amount of power to oppose this force. World quickly politically remapped, integration completed, resistances quickly stomped and there are only three nations left. After the ordeal, they shake hands, put their tin foil hats back on and promptly go back to arguing whose dick is bigger through politics, media and the Internet."
worldnews,"Well you can't just occupy a territory and then kick the people out. That's ethnic cleansing and is one of the worst war crimes on the planet.

When you occupy a territory, you have three choices:

1. Return the territory to some other country (say Jordan.)

2. Grant the territory independence.

3. Integrate the territory into your own and make the people living on that land citizens of your country.

It doesn't matter who owned or didn't own Palestinian territory. There's people living in the West Bank who Israel has effectively made stateless. Instead of granting them citizenship, independence, or giving the territory to Jordan, Israel has instead chose to institute Apartheid through a policy of slowly corralling the Arabs living in the West Bank into ghettos.

There have been situations where a member of a family has been kidnapped, and told to perform whatever action or their entire family will be killed. Their control of the country and their fundamentalist ideologies  are what will be the downfall of that country. The Muslim religion is not a bad religion, nor ""full of terrorists"" but you have really bad people that are using this religion for an agenda that is dangerous. I do not believe that the US can completely eliminate the Taliban. They are so widespread, but I do believe we should exercise some forms of control to maintain security for the American people."

Not to say accidents or other events can't happen that result in a loss of a hull, its pretty unlikely to happen without warning on a 777 traveling at 32,000 feet. At the planes likely airspeed and reported altitude the pilots should have had time to react, aviate, communicate to air traffic or towers, and finally navigate the plane someplace. What is coming out is the plane just disappeared which points to a tragic sudden loss of the aircraft. "

As a high functioning aspie Ive tried to look into it but the contradictions are rife, psychologists say one thing, doctors say another and the internet itself is just one big mess.

Also, can it be fix'd? I know I should be thankful for being 'special' and highly intelligent etc but I could really do without haha

Addendum: how is autism in relation to genetics? My mom claims shes an aspie and my ex says that my son has been tested as an aspie as well. My fear is that because psychologists are writing so many things away to ADD and autism that its just a bunch of bull. However if it is genetic, it would make sense"

Says who?  There is a fair amount of covering in Malaysia and Indonesia.  I can't personally vouch for others like Bangladesh, Iran, Morocco, Nigeria, and Albania since I haven't been there, but you can't deny they're relevant data points for comparison if nothing else.

&gt;Do you think it would be more interesting if they gathered data about covering up in countries that did not cover up as much? Come on now. 

I think it'd be a more accurate of Islam as a whole, and therefore necessarily more interesting.  By only including Arab countries (and Arab-adjacent Turkey, plus, to be fair, non-Arab Pakistan) we're not really seeing a complete picture of how much of the custom is due to Islam and how much is due to Arab culture.

I'm not really interested in the results of a survey with this much undercoverage bias."

Also, there are plenty of times in aviation history where a totally unexpected and unforeseeable design flaw or mechanical failure caused a plane to go down. Then the NTSB or the FAA (or whatever international agency) finds out the cause and issues an AD to fix it on the fleet. 

At least you said ""probably"", the original commenters ""The first plane was pure incompetence"" made it sound like he know something we didn't."

There are going to be thousands of articles that they put the $5 of effort into that earned $0 revenue,

If this was a false flag op it is going terrible for AQ. Furthermore it is bringing the rebel groups together. Once ISIS is gone who is to say they won't take the opportunity to take out AQ? I know that's what i'd do, fuck sharing with those assholes"

Although they also say that antidepressants can help make new pathways more quickly. At least, that's what I took from the article. "

iama,"Very good point. I suppose the best option is to have it legal on the federal level, but permit states to make it illegal on their own. This might also help get some federal money into the study of marijuana for medical purposes, something that countries like Israel have been embracing. And keeping it illegal but unenforced on the federal level definitely poses a risk for entrepreneurs to worry about, although it doesn't seem to be stopping venture capitalists from flooding Colorado with money. Thanks for pointing that out though! It's a point I'll make sure to clarify when I discuss the topic in the future - that formal legality is preferable on the federal level, provided that states are free to make it illegal on their own."

I actually saved the charity from imploding that day too because without an internet connection, they would've missed out on their lottery grant.

iama,"Westerners seem highly concerned that Ebola could come to western nations, but I am curious about your thoughts of whether Ebola could be a threat to the India/Thailand/Indonesia/SE China region.  There are a highly dense population of people in some of those areas living in conditions not far removed from those in West Africa.  Would an outbreak in one of those regions likely be quickly contained, as was seen in Nigeria?  

My second question if you have time relates to where the health care workers are going to come from to contain the current epidemic in West Africa.  I read that it takes 400 workers to properly staff a 100 bed clinic.  With a need to isolate 70% of those infected and likely 20,000 infected or more by November, are alternative methods being explored to control the epidemic, such as home care?  It seems unlikely that 60,000 to 80,000 health care workers would be found by November.  "

The city has a lot of history as well, and you can experience that history even when going out. Malasaña, for example, is a neighbourhood where la Movida (cultural revolution in Madrid in late 70-early 80) was most present, and all the bars in the area still carry that spirit. "
science,"You use the word theory as though it means guess or something unsubstantiated, the way creationist say ""evolution is just a theory, though,"" or the way libertarians are fond of saying ""socialism works fine in theory, but human nature..."" But when the word is used in regard to science, it refers to the body of scientific data that has been gathered over time. So when someone says something about theories of evolution or the big bang, they are saying that scientific discovery over the past however-many years supports these ideas.

i.e., Scientific theory is scientific fact, or as close to it as we can come.

In my opinion, it all comes down to educating customers, consumers, shoppers,... and engaging in a good dialogue with all of them. The benefit of GMs are manyfold, and the only way people will learn about all these things is to engage in education and conversation, while at the same time allowing people to express their feelings and perhaps even fears, and addressing them with scientific facts. As an example of a great benefit of GMs, I would point out how nowadays a crop that contains a GM trait against insects needs to get sprayed with less chemicals, ultimately better for the environment."

Grid parity also applies to wind power where it varies according to wind quality and existing distribution infrastructure. ExxonMobil predicts wind power real cost will approach parity with natural gas and coal without carbon sequestration and be cheaper than natural gas and coal with carbon sequestration by 2025.[19]

Wind turbines reached grid parity in some areas of Europe in the mid-2000s, and in the US around the same time. Falling prices continue to drive the levelized cost down and it has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010, and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12%.

How our minds represent colors is already metaphor-ish. The nervous system pins certain wavelengths to certain nervous impulses to certain mental representations. AFAIK, there is nothing suggesting that mantis shrimp have a greater number of mental representations of color than do people. In fact, their nervous systems are a lot less complicated than ours. Even though they see a broader spectrum than us, they might be conceiving of that spectrum entirely as various shades of red, or something of that nature. The video  probably could have represented a wider spectrum by normalizing it to the visible range.

What would, by these industry standards make someone 'qualified' to work in data marketing out here?

Expensive tech - what seems to be the industry standard for database and modeling? It seems like there is no standard, at all.

Would you mind if I toss some private questions at you?"
science,"I think we're probably on the same page here, since you acknowledge that it takes a ""mindboggling"" amount of time to produce some of these changes naturally, even with artificial selection. The only problem I have is when people compare artificial selection to GMO as if they're literally the *exact same thing.* It's easy to refute and hurts your credibility. That artificial selection also includes thousands of years of selection against strains that are harmful, which you don't get when you pop a gene from one organism into another in a lab and start growing it."
iama,"Props for citing PKD, Barbara, and thanks for doing the AMA.  I read Nickel and Dimed years ago after my (now) wife had read it, and I still reference it today when people want to talk about poverty issues and employment.  It still rings true, because even though I'm a salaried member of management in QA in manufacturing, I've seen how some of my employers have exploited their workers and the desperate lives some of those workers live.

At the same time, while my life situation has improved somewhat through hard work, help from others I've worked with, and a *big* chunk of luck, I still work my butt off in fear of losing my job, my benefits, and in fear of letting down the workers who are laid off when the company's fortunes drop.  I've seen far too much of that."
worldnews,"I don't think they were happy. People grumble about the government all the time.

But they were not ""let me take a Kalashnikov and go shoot Ukrainians while my city is completely ruined by war"" unhappy. Nowhere close.

It took Russian officers and mercenaries doing the well choreographed take-over of all local government buildings there, and then arming all the local thugs and drunkards before it happened.

If the elections would have been allowed to happen, the situation would have stabilized with about 1000x less aggravation and bloodshed for everyone - both Russians and Ukrainians.

But that didn't play into Putin's interests, so he arranged this civil war to serve as an example as to what happens if you don't play to his tune."
todayilearned,"It depends of the period. The Umayyids were fanatics. They governed for about three hundred years. The Almoravids weren't particularly good or bad, they were concerned mostly with consolidating their rule for the hundred or so years they were around, but the Almohad's were what many associate as golden age of Andalus, with the universities and and tolerance etc. They lasted about two hundred years, but started losing wars against the Christians. This was blamed on not being Islamic enough and the Maranids were like any typical post-Crusade Islamist kingdom. "
iama,"&gt; what metrics can I use to measure balance in a horizontal system?

**Yuval**: This is more of a tech-designer, or a games programmer question. But I'll say that in a complicated enough game you're going to need a genetic algorithm strategizing and microing all unit/spell combinations for the best results. A poor man's automated balance tool is a heuristic function for how good something is (e.g. dps/cost). And of course you have a full range of nice solutions in between those two extremes.


&gt; Also, how much of your data tools consists of vb scripts in excell?:)

**Yuval**: Zero.

I can see with the whole oil trade and deals between USA and Saudi , it affecting other relationships. Then again I am not a big fan of the kingdom of Saudi and my predisposed opinion is from personal experiences and they way the country treats foreign laborers and generally rabid laws and stuff. .

At one point I was living with 3 other girls, one of the roommates (bless her sweet little heart, we lived SO well together) and I realized we were the only ones doing any chores around the house. So we stopped. We watched one of the roommates walk into the kitchen with an empty fast food bag, look at the overflowing trashcan (it had a lid) and place it on top and walk away. The thing was clearly full for over a week and neither of them took it out for a week."

It has been argued that pre columbian trans atlantic trade is the reason for this, however, gourds float very well and could've simply floated over without any human intervention at all. 

It has been also been argued that the Olmec stone heads may have been carved by Africans because the facial features (lips, nose) appear more African than Olmec. But that was made up by some butt hole who thinks that anything with big lips must be African."

In fact, Mark Jackson's subsequent huddle and instruction seemed to have come only after the taunting violation.

Regardless, not allowing a record to be broken by intentional fouling without incident, isn't exactly ""dirty.""

Everything gets documented, even the lack of documentation gets documented.  Which is how we even know that it happened.  
  
I can 99% guarantee you that any time a contractor walks around with that sort of cash, he signed off on a hand receipt.  Hell, it's the only reason the Army trusted me with like $10k in shit like noise canceling headphones and a Wacom Cintiq.

The same people who advocate for harsh penalties for drug use and distribution are in many cases the same folks who want to dictate what kind of sex you can and cannot have and in what context it is ok to engage in sexual activity. Controlling others behaviour is an all too common means of obtaining power.

Being an American and traveling with a group of similarly minded college kids, they proceed to try to tie on the most serious buzz of their lives. Somewhere around round 7, they switch bars, and my buddy approaches the bartender. He does the unthinkable: orders four Irish Car Bombs, in Dublin, on St. Patty's day. 

Bartender spiked his bar towel and screamed at him, ""Don't you EVER order that drink in my town again, do you hear me!? If you want that, then order a half-pint of Guinness with a half-shot of Baileys and a half-shot of Jameson and we'll know what the FUCK you're talkin' about!"" My friends proceed to apologize profusely, down the drinks, tip profusely, and leave for another bar. Moral of the story: don't do that. "

Hehe

Tunisia, Turkey, and Syria* all banned the burka or public face coverings, those are widely considered repressive regimes.
(Tunisia and Syria removed the ban in 2011)

Of the worlds 167 democratic nations, only the Netherlands, Belgium and France have enacted bans, even if you count Spain's proposed bad, that's still something like 2.3% of democracies.

Implying that democracies are the heart of religious repression is the sort of delusion that deserves to be called out.

Especially when China, Uzbekistan and other repressive nations are banning ""muslim looking"" beards and dress.

iama,"There are different settings depending on the sandwich but some people don't adhere to them. For example, pre-cut meats like turkey, ham, and roast beef have one setting whereas bigger items like chicken and steak have another setting.

6"" sandwiches like the turkey, club, and melt are toasted for 15 seconds (23 seconds for a Footlong). 6"" sandwiches like the buffalo chicken or the steak and cheese are toasted for 20 seconds (33 seconds for a Footlong). All sandwiches with double meat are toasted for 30 seconds (6"") or 45 seconds (12"").

It sounds like you're getting a chicken or steak sandwich and the people are toasting it like its a turkey sandwich when you need it triple toasted.

The best way to do it is to ask for a specific time for it to be toasted, ""Can I have it toasted for X amount of seconds?"".

No problem and all, he was just concerned that I was getting serious over the deal. So we had a few dozen beers, talked about all sorts of crazy assed stuff at the irish bar, and then a few other friends joined to talk, and it turned to local politics and other useless BS. Or so I though.

I thought they were doing very original things - stretching film language in ways I'd never seen before.

It can be tough to take a long break from something and come back and have it be just as good as it was before, but damnit you guys nailed it! I loved season 8, it was possibly even my favorite season of the bunch. It felt very natural, and everyone reprises their characters so well. My question is, was it hard to get all of the other original actors (Lahey, J-Roc, T, Sarah, Lucy, Corey, Sam, Barb, Cyrus, etc.) to come back for another season, or was everyone really excited and into the idea? Thanks for a great show guys, and I can't wait for more seasons!"

The real problem, though, is the one Musk pointed out: if robots are more capable than us, why would they still consider us their masters?"
iama,"Might have been a specific market test. Every year so many items make it through to the store level for testing. But we can't flood one market with all the new products. Would create an issue for the tried and true products that sell.

If the numbers look good they do a full roll out across the country. Individual franchises then decide if they want that new item or not. 

If the test item doesn't sell, the product goes into a ""better luck next time"" pile. Some may get a second test run at a later date in a different area. "

If you side with the conservatives, you're going to have massive national debt to fuel the military-industrial complex, bans on contraception, abstinence-only education leading to massive teen pregnancy rates, Creationism taught in public schools, I could go on and on.

Similarly, we should not put very much worth into skin color if it means that people will be hurt by it.

We should, however, accept each other as fellow humans, regardless of race, nationality, ethnicity, etc, and treat each other with respect. If we feel that we should be able to have a home, we should secure for others the same privilege."

worldnews,"Russia has approximately the same military firepower of any of the singular NATO nations if they were to go against each other one on one (France, UK, Italy etc.).

Obviously that's not going to happen because of NATO, they would all team together, but do not underestimate Russia's military and nuclear capabilities. 

And again it is an empty threat on both sides, hence why NATO will never be able to go against Russia. Also, 30% of EU consumption comes from Russia, but in certain countries in the east it is more than 60%-80%. 

Also, China can ally with Russia mainly because of their economic ties with the US. China and Russia can essentially do whatever they want, the US will not fight China because their economies are too linked, and Europe will not fight Russia because their economies are too linked, the big question is the countries in between.

todayilearned,"Actually, depression medication is very well understood. SSRIs - selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors - basically increase the amount of serotonin that your brain is using. If the cause of someone's depression is low serotonin, then the SSRI will absolutely help. If it's caused by something else, then it won't help. 

Different drugs work differently for different people. I haven't had any problems with my SSRI medication (other than short lived dizziness and headaches), but other people have problems like you did. And it says that on the packs too. The problem is that there aren't any tests to check what the cause of someone's depression is, so everything's just trial and error."

Last winter was non-stop -20C for about four months, and people dress for it, when they're walking, cycling and waiting for public transit, to get from place to place.

This is all assuming that religion is equal to non-religion. Religion is a mythological construct anyway, so you have delusion versus reality. Still, religion can be useful as crowd control and ensuring some basic protection against murder, etc. especially by those less intelligent and susceptible to committing violent crime otherwise, but it's a problem today because of the violence, hatred, and social conservatism that comes with it.

So far only one GE crop non-corporate crop has made it past deregulation, the Rainbow papaya, and it has been hugely successful, but now no one else is getting the funding to jump through the hurdles of deregulation.

Second, has GMO answers ever considered doing pieces on background information, a topic sorely lacking in consumer education, like about resistance breakdown for when the 'superpest' claim comes up, or other things done to crops (selective breeding, hybridization, gene introgression from wild species, bud sport selection, induced polyploidy, ect.) so that people have the background context on the topic to realize that there are more than just two methods of crop improvement for the labeling issue."

And I also realised that there wasn't a hard surface for a very long distance, mostly just sand and grass. So these birds have learned this pathway is good for dropping things on to eat. What did they do before man interfered? Generally speaking in the wilderness there isn't large flat places to drop things onto."

It's not just about needles but about finding what's happening with your life, and addressing those issues. Acupuncture does help with the metabolism - but changing your diet, exercise, and emotional components are important as well. "

Anyone who thinks there's not a chance NATO will send troops into Ukraine at the invitation of the Ukrainian government hasn't been paying attention. Ukraine, NATO, and Eastern European NATO member nations have been publicly discussing such action since Russia annexed Crimea. Anyone who thinks that a European civilian plane being shot down won't bring us much, much closer to such action is deluded.

This has been ongoing since 2010. The hospitals, homeless shelters, prison system, and the government of Florida (which shut down the only TB hospital in the state during this outbreak) are highly responsible for this epidemic. These agencies colluded together and did not follow proper disease protocol which led to a higher infection rates. The hospitals and shelters stopped allowing homeless individuals with symptoms to stay and instead started keeping TB infected people in a make shift quarantine zone in  un-certified hotels near the airport that were still open to the public. This led to expanded TB reports. Someone from NY became infected with TB in Florida, travelled back home, and then spread it in NY.

todayilearned,"When I started one of my previous jobs we had an induction day where we had various presentations about the company and so on and one of them was a video from HR about how seriously the company takes diversity.

After ten minutes of this, the presenter says ""if you feel you are being discriminated against, feel free to contact us"" and puts up a slide of the HR team. Fifteen white women and one man who had the most junior job title of the lot.

I later discovered that the company also gave women time off on International Women's Day to 'attend seminars and other related events'."
iama,"You can only patent new breeds. All plant breeds, for the most part, were patented at some point in time, ever since the 1930 Plant Patent Act. This includes all the organic heirloom breeds, several of which are still patented today for the more recent breeds.

That's the thing about patents, they expire. And they will expire for biotech crops as well eventually, just like everything else. Seed patents are nothing new, so it is really strange that it is suddenly an issue now. Seems more like a fabricated issue to me. "
askreddit,"When I was 15, my mother randomly decided one day to rifle through the contents of my backpack. She found a condom and lost her shit.  She all but called me a slut, threatening to disown me if I got pregnant as a teenager.  She told me she wouldn't pay for my college, that she would send me to a home for unwed mothers, etc.

No matter how I tried to tell her I was still a virgin, she wasn't having it. In her mind, there was no possible reason at all to have a condom unless you were slutting it up at every available opportunity. "
iama,"Excellent questions. First, thanks for following my site, it means a lot to me. Now to answer your questions.

Yes, sections meaning verse and or hook.. Just enough to get the listener's attention. As far as going back and making 'full songs'. It depends, sometimes it's a simple process depending on the genre of music. Other times it could take hours sifting through ideas, keeping with the excitement expressed through the snippet and being sure not to over produce.

The best method for turning over work fast (for me) is having a strong workflow. That has to be developed overtime.  I also have templates for different types of cues, that shaves off a lot of time as well especially when arranging and making edits.

The great thing about templates is once you've created a good sound/mix, you can always go back to it rather than starting over from scratch. And that's how I like to work 'smarter' not 'harder'."
iama,"Yes and No.

I love being a stuntman and all I ever wanted was to be a working stuntman and have my peers say - 'yeah Nick's a good stuntman'. That was it. I have a good career and it is moving forward. 

However, there is a darkside. It is VERY political and to a certain extenet you have to play the game. 

But the worst thing is seeing your friends get hurt. I have friends in wheelchairs, colleagues without limps and others with career eneding injuries. 

It is a tough industry in more ways than one. "

The best things you can do are go to camps and contact your assigner to work higher level games to improve. If you constantly ask to be assigned with the best referees in your town, learn from them."
iama,"I'm a little late to the party, but hopefully you can answer this. I'm currently reading ""The Hot Zone"" by Richard Preston. Now, I know it was written back in the mid 90's so I'm curious to how much of the information has changed since then. There are large sections of the book that deal with the possibility of Ebola being an airborne virus, that can be transferred from one animal to another without contact. I'm assuming this belief has changed. Also, the book mentions that the virus can survive on a plane for 24 hours without any hosts on board. Am I reading something factual? or has this become more of a an entertaining thriller to read that isn't quite factually acurate? Thanks Ben!"

I did a few calculations based on small firm IT purchasing prices (and we all know that datacenters get things cheaper) and the cost of storage plus once-monthly transmission of this article would be around 0.042 cents. Per year. For an article that is in the public domain. And that's being generous. If you are paying a sysadmin 100K a year he would have been paid 19 cents in the time it took to download. 


So that means that their profit on this PUBLIC DOMAIN article is 150.times greater than actual cost. "
iama,"I have a buddy who is one of the top rewrite guys in hollywood. Insane money. His take is that it's an entirely different beast, and I tend to agree. I'll say that most pro screenwriters tend to know a lot more about story structure than a lot of authors I've met, but that's a function of their gig. They tend to really study story, whereas I think novelists tend to sit down and start writing. I know that's how it worked for me. I actually looked at developing JET into a screenplay, and once I took a hard look at what was involved, I decided not to. They're very different forms, at least to my eye."
science,"It depends on the study and what you are trying to find. You can't take a couple thousand individuals and then deduce a nationwide inference or worldwide trend. Similarly, you need a giant amount of data to determine a strong correlation with something like GMO effect on animals.

On studies where you have a few thousand people, those people generally fit some sort of criteria (age, socioeconomic status, sex, cancer patient, etc, etc) and so you do not need to sample a million of them. When testing GMO effect on animals in general, you need a LARGE population."
worldnews,"Im not acting like some hotshot knowitall, its pretty basic bio knowledge. And the american definition of sexual assault includes groping and coercion. I have seen plenty of cases where girls argue they got too drunk and slept with someone and regarded it as sexual assault. There is a kot of grey area. Anyway if the western world has relatively low rape compared to the rest of the world I dont see what you are trying to point out. Every country has some level or crime in it. While we do our best to minimize it, the ones with a lot more crime are obviously a bigger problem. And I dont see how you think America has  predominating rape culture when sexual equality is both taught from a young age in most households and represented in the laws."
science,"Thank you for your time today.

When I contracted EBV I had an extreme reaction (swollen body, full body rash, swollen and purple face, extreme fever etc.) which lasted about 48 hours then began to subside. I returned to relatively full health within 5 days.

Some 12 months later I developed a rash on my side that was, 11 years later, diagnosed as mycosis fungoides. I was young to have developed this form of CTCL. Approximately 28.

While the role of EBV in B-Cell lymphomas is known it appears as though it is unclear whether it may be involved in T-cell lymphomas, and especially CTCL.

I would appreciate any feedback you may have in relation to EBV and T-cell lymphomas.

Thanks again."
todayilearned,"Hmm to that end, how come you went with an RX1 then over say a fuji x-pro1 or x-e2 system? The glass in that line is pretty fantastic and god damn do they tempt me away from full frame at times. While I struggle to justify leaving the beautiful world of 85 1.4's and 50 1.4's behind at least in my main body of work, that seems less of a differentiating factor between the X-series and the RX1. 

What with some of the incredible deals on the X-M1 and the overall lust factory of the X-series glass it seems to me that it just makes more sense to go with one of those than the RX1? That said if they could make a full frame X100 model up to their standards with a 40-50mm lens I would be all over that even if it cost more than the RX1R haha"
iama,"El Mira was also corrupt in the sense that when the guards would write misbehavior reports, alleging that a prisoner broke a rule, there would often fabricate part of the report. Sometimes, when violence was occuring, the guards were either the direct or indirect cause of it or they would walk in the opposite direction so as to be able to avoid breaking things up and having to file paperwork afterwards. It was also clear to me that the ""hearing officer"" presiding over the kangaroo court in which the misbehavior reports were considered had already predetermied, before the preceeding began, that they were going to find the inmate guilty. It was frivolous to complain to supervising officers and the prison administration about employee misconduct because they were only interested in backing up their co worker rather than truly supervising and maintaining order."

worldnews,"So a doctor in a hospital amputating a finger from you would be the same level of funsies as your uncle chopping your finger off in the middle of a wood and not taking you to a hospital afterwards, putting a rag on top and patting you on the back? They're both medical procedures, right?

The culture of cannibalism is as bad as the culture of free speech because they're both cultures?

The age difference is well documented. FGM happens to children, type 1-3 cannot be performed on infants. Circumcision usually happens within a week of birth OR when the person is an adult and can choose for himself, unless it is a medical procedure. Culture and religion around circumcision very clearly states that it needs to be done in infancy, not childhood or adulthood.

The amount of suffering FGM victims go through makes it a completely different ETHICAL and MEDICAL situation. "
iama,"I was a commercial lines adjuster for less than three years.

I'm not sure what ""set me apart,"" I wonder that from time to time because a LOT of people want to get into SIU and a lot of people always interview. I think part of it is that I tried. Maybe that sounds stupid or obvious, but I think that half the battle of getting something is to have confidence in yourself. I networked with people and I consider myself a good interviewer. When I applied, I didn't try to apologize for my lack of experience or unique background; instead, I used these as selling points. Of course, I believe you should do that in any interview.

Also, my boss from my former position apparently highly recommended me.

science,"For me, the similarity lies in the analysis that is ongoing when I'm listening, performing, and writing music vs. analysis and procedure in math.  When I'm working on a long problem, there's a sense of direction, tension, and resolution as critical points in the solution are worked out.  Humans like things that involve repeating patterns, progression, structure, and we like things most of all when they resolve concretely, so it shouldn't be surprising that those desires are applied across multiple fields via the concept of beauty."

I realized I was out of frosty beverages and cigs so I wrapped the hibatchi with aluminum foil and ran to the store. When I got back my balcony was in flames. I ran up stairs and had to use my coffee pot to put the fire out then had to pull the wood apart so I could get some water in between. Luckily for me the complex was being painted and the very next day they painted over the charred corner of the balcony. I still didn't get my deposit back but that was for another reason. I was also lucky in the respect that no one noticed and called the fire department."

iama,"in customer service it's also your job to make the customer happy no matter how much of a shitbag they are, especially at large chains.

iama,"I can answer this question for him:

Out of over six million ATF Form 4473's (aka the background check you get when purchasing from a firearms dealer) filed in 2009, about 71,000 came back as denials. This means that a person prohibited from purchasing a firearm attempted to anyways, and lied on a federal form to do it.

Out of those about 71,000 denials, about 4,600 were referred from the FBI NICS, who performs the background check, to an ATF field office for further review. That's around 6%.

Of those ~4,600 referrals, 110 were referred for prosecution. 63 of those were declined by the prosecutor. The remaining 47 went to court and either got a guilty plea (31), a plea deal (17), or are still being worked on as of [the report I'm referencing](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/grants/234173.pdf).

science,"Here is my problem with GM crops, and I will use Monsanto's soybean crop as an example.  

Monsanto has developed a soybean which is genetically modified to resist the adverse affects of its herbicide, Roundup. Roundup is basically a poison, meant to kill weeds and other plants on which it is sprayed.  

Now, while the soybean may have been genetically modified to survive an industrial dosage of this toxin… I have not.  

So when I eat this Monsanto-patented soybean, I am also consuming its lifetime supply of being saturated in harmful chemicals. And my body was not meant to consume these things. 

TL;DR: It's not the genetically modified crop that will kill me-- the crop itself is fine. It's the reason the crop has been modified-- to survive a lifetime of herbicides and pesticides. The remnants of which make it into our food supply.  "
iama,"Have you been following the news on what they use the people skilled in computer science for? They basically teach them hacking so they can use it to attack South Korea. Everything the outside does for the population they ultimately do for the leaders. So, no, you didn't do anything humanitarian. You were just a step on the way to them fucking with South Korea. There's no point in helping the country advance as long as they have their current government in place. They won't use their newfound knowledge for good. I don't know what you were thinking. "
science,"I actually have 3 boys, aged 6 and under. It is not a good workout- it is just work and can be physically demanding, but does not reap the heart healthy benefits of exercise. I define a good workout as any physical exercise that raises and sustains an elevated heart rate for a period of time, while incorporating either catabolic or anabolic properties for major muscle groups. Based on observation alone, most parents to not lift their children in a proper and safe athletic position, nor do they do reps. Chasing children is not ""all day"" that is an exaggeration, it seems like all day, but really parenting provides short bursts of physical activity that do not elevate the heart rate enough to have any real physical benefits."

I'm not really into tomato, but once in a while I will surprise myself with tomatoes. And then I'll put the lox on there, and then put some peppers, and then I will cut it in half and go to town. That's the first thing that popped into my head when you said sandwich, but it's hard to beat a good cheeseburger. As I'm thinking about it, and then the eastern thing is cool too, falafels and pita pockets, those are awful great too. I like sandwiches, now I'm thinking about all kinds of sandwiches. "

I work closely with primatologists at a zoo and have specficially witnessed chimpanzees conforming to the behavior of those around them. Of course that exists. 

The qualifier here is that it isn't merely ""to fit in.""

Social learning is not what is in question, it is ""to what end."" 

Grass-in-ear can be seen as pack behavior. The function is not unlike wearing any other group identifier. If you integrate another group, you will definitely see them NOT adopting that ""accoutrement"" ... we don't do that because it will also likely lead to bloodshed. The part that is misleading in the smithsonian article -- as evidenced by the strange typo -- is that it did NOT spread from group to group. 

You can plainly see the difference between children's conformity and group conformity in other primates.

iama,"How much actual evidence (falsified, peer-reviewed etc.) is there that marijuana is beneficial in a medical capacity? 

I ask because I know that it is considered a class A drug in the US which makes it illegal to perform medical experiments with it. And I fear that the medical angle is being used as a stalking horse to get marijuana legalized for recreational use. I have no issue with it being used recreationally and would vote for its legalization but I would rather the intentions of lobbyists were honest and just came out and said ""we enjoy smoking weed, please let us do it legally and safely"".

The amount of cannabis coming off one plant is A LOT too. Depending on your consumption method and rate of use, the harvest of one plant could last a year. I know because I grow my own and I'm literally giving most of it away to my friends.

iama,"That sounds like a workflow issue with several possible solutions. 

First of all, Inbox separates purchases and promos and shows search results that are prioritized (try searching for something you bought recently, the product receipt/package tracking data comes first then the other emails). 

Secondly, Inbox helps with overwhelming emails by having some actions available right within the app - like one click unsubscribe or confirmations. 

Third, Inbox has a different paradigm and requires a different approach than standard email. Trying to foist your current workflow on it isn't the best path to take or the most satisfactory. It requires a little bit of thinking and adaptation but the cognitive overhead isn't as much as, say, learning how to use Gmail like a pro and setting up fine-grained filters. "

Also, cow shit has nitrogen in it, so naturally grazing (at or below carrying capacity) will lead to fertilization of the soil.

Dealers stocks of loot - I thought one part of their MO was to recycle pieces through auctions (a practice which was exposed and has largely stopped). Another point is that the pieces  Peter Watson looked at were largely Classical pieces, mainly vases and statuary.

Great AMA, thanks for all your answers and for the work you do!

My questions are about your training regime. I guess you have a lot of areas to train (strength, acrobatics, martial arts...) how do you do to keep up with all those and specially to avoid one conflicting with the rest (for example strength with acrobatics) What does it look like your weekly training schedule? And how does it got affected when you're working in a film?

edit: also, if I may add, you mentioned being able to perform top of the hat... how do you achieve that (besides drilling and drilling I guess), what are your warm-up routine (both physically and mentally) on set and how do you manage to stay ""warmed up"" during the filming? 

Thanks a lot!"
iama,"&gt; Hockey is managed between the players most of the time. If a dirty player is going after a team's superstar player, that team will send one of their best fighters after the other team's dirty player.
&gt; It sends a message that you shouldn't mess with our best player and take cheap shots at him.
&gt; Also, fighting has an honor code. Much like golf's honor code (except golf has no violence). Once a player goes down, the fight's over. You can be losing the fight for 2 minutes and getting your ass kicked, but if your opponent falls to the ice, you stop fighting.
&gt; It may seem brutal and barbaric, but it's regulated internally through the players. All of the players know the code and they all follow it. That's why you very rarely see 5 or 10 game suspensions from fighting in the NHL because there is no need for it.

todayilearned,"&gt;because its cool all religious services should be held in ancient and dead languages

No, that's a massive exaggeration.  Religions that have centuries of history of the service being celebrated in a ""dead language"" (since when is Arabic or Hebrew 'dead'?) shouldn't be abruptly changed without any real alternative.  

Even the Catholics did continue to offer a mass in Latin but it was entirely new, devoid of almost everything that the previous one had.  Language is a part of it, but not all of it. 

&gt;You have created a fantasy in which people in the past were somehow more spiritual and less dickish than that hippy soccer mom you hate.

No, it was simply more reverent.  That's an objective observation. Go to the Tridentine mass celebrated since the 13th century with the ""celebration"" changed after Vatican II and its obviously and intentionally less solemn.  

What they should have done was preserve the old mass at least for feasts or special occasions.

1) Why an arbitrary cut off of 75,000 dollars?
2) What is the purchasing power over time?

Adjusted for inflation the median household income has remained stagnant for almost 30 years while purchasing power, or the things you can buy with your money, has steadily decreased.

todayilearned,"The EPA estimates that 24,000 Americans die prematurely each year because of soot from old coal plants. How many Americans die year because of nuclear power? Nuclear is perceived as dangerous, but it's not.

Chernobyl, for example, less than a dozen people died of thyroid cancer linked to radioactive Iodine exposure up until 2005, the rates of thyroid cancer (which has a cure rate approaching 99%) are now decreasing. 

Clean up workers, which popular myth thinks are dropping dead like flies, we're limited to an exposure of 100 millisieverts, and approx 1% increase in cancer risk.

This must be compared to lifestyle and other environmental effects on cancer risk, smoking, meat rich diet, lack of exercise, smog, alcohol etc., that can vary cancer risk by as much as 38%.

iama,"Prison was like a non stop obstacle course, featuring the guards, the prisoners and the staff, all as obstacles to the ultimate goal, prove my innocense and regain my freedom. Respect and human dignity are often lacking in prison, there was alot of violence, both involving weapons and not, along with plenty of gang activity. It is not similar to how the media portrays it. The media often portrays a prevelance of rapes. I didn't find that to be true. On the other hand, there was much more violence, as well as various levels of abuse by the guards and civilians. 

There is no stigma attached to people who convicted of murder, rather there is a stigma for being incarcerated for a sex offence. There is a vigilante mentality in prison towards people who have been convicted of sex offences. There was always a fear that the crimes for which i was convicted of would come out."

I've never been an auto adjuster but I know many and obviously work with them now. Auto adjusters generally handle more claims than anyone else. It's fast paced work. The day will go by quickly and as long as you can efficiently make decisions and stay focused you'll be fine. 

With that being said- responsibilities of an auto adjuster vary by company. Some companies have a different adjuster for the liability, medical, and crash damage portions of each auto claim. The liability adjusters get the fun job of determining who is liable, as the name implies, and it seems like they're the most stressed. Ones that stuck around and do decent work move up fast.

Hope that helps.  I'd share adjuster stories but I'm now typing on my phone so I'll merely say that I did step on a dead  raccoon in the basement of a vacant apartment I was inspecting as an adjuster. "

science,"I can only speak for the dairy industry since I have pretty much zero experience with beef cattle, but the modern dairy industry seems to (at least at the level of large commercial operations) realize that healthy and well tended cows make more milk, have better reproductive health, and get sick less often. Dairy cattle have two jobs: make milk and make calves, and they do both of those jobs much better when they're in good health. The motivation is still focused around maximizing profit like any big business, but the welfare of dairy cows is significantly better than it used to be because good welfare is profitable for them and now we have all the data and research to prove it thanks to computer tracking. Again, I have no idea about the beef industry so someone else would have to answer in that regard."

science,"Hi,

After browsing /r/Nootropics a little while I have decided to try a box of piracetam. Not only I didn't noticed anything after taking it, but after about six months I have started to have myoclonus all over my body, everyday, a few times a day.

After reading on the topic I found out that choline rich diet could fix this and decided to improve my diet using choline rich foods like livers and eggs. That was totally it. I'm living a normal life if I eat at least once a week a little bow of some random choline rich food. If I don't, myoclonus comes back.

Please be honest, will this last forever? I mean, have you ever read about myoclonus to ever go away? What do you know about choline and why it's beneficial for this condition (since my doctor have no idea on their relation)? 

Ps. My neurologist said a couple things about it and he has no idea on the choline and myoclonus relation, so I'm asking his expert opinion, no medical advices please.

Thanks."

The process works really well and has a lot of benefits, namely we reduce code duplication, and it makes it much easier for each of the Inbox clients (web, Android, iOS) to ship features together. The logic is written once and then ported to all 3 platforms, leaving the frontend developers to focus on the UI. 

The biggest downside is that sometimes the shared code has to be written in weird ways because it needs to support the quirks of each platform. For example, we avoid overloaded methods due to the way GWT exports them.

The tools (j2objc and GWT, specifically) are definitely production-ready. One thing that’s helped us a lot is that we have folks who work on these tools on our team as well. A lot of GWT patches that have landed in the last year were specifically for Inbox’s use cases."

i would doubt race or nationality would be much of an indicator of intelligence, considering we havnt been breeding with each other to produce such results over the course of human evolution. individual people or families would be a much bigger factor, given the genetic diversity of our species. this is what this experiment is showing.

* It gets better. You can train being hypnotized and going deeper. Repeating inductions make them more effective.

If anything, a small blanket of CO2 is gonna be layered over the top of your beer that keeps air out would be what I'd expect to happen; CO2 is heavier than air. The bubbles going down the glass in a pint of Guinness is fun glass physics, but it's not actually pulling anything into the beer really.

Quick and dirty science lesson on carbonation: The CO2 gets suspended in the beer (or any liquid) because the CO2 is trying to reach some equilibrium with the CO2 pressure in the head space of the keg/bottle/can and the beer itself. Once you pop the top/pour it, the head space's CO2 pressure is dropped off to normal air amounts (the hiss), and the beer starts letting off bubbles to try to reach equilibrium again."

Covering the head with a scarf or shawl was always the standard in Eastern Europe, and still is among women over 50 in many parts. Even in the west, traditionally women would cover their heads with hats or a shawl of some kind until relatively recently. The cultural notion that women should cover heads and shoulders and legs is one shared among cultures all over the middle east, Europe, central Asia, the Indian sub-continent and north Africa. 

  Interestingly, if you look at visual representations of women from the early 1400s around Eurasia, you'll find that it's the European women who are most fully covered. From head to toe, only the face showing. All that's happened is that in western Europe and the areas outside Eurasia where western Europeans migrated, there has been an enormous change. Most of the rest of the Eurasia has simply not changed quite as radically regarding women's dress.

science,"Well, the fact is, sometimes you don't know the effects of something until much, much later.

As for medications, that's different and is entirely dependent on the disease or condition that's being treated. Look at AIDS and HIV. People were doing ANYTHING to get treatments, and some of our usual procedures were relaxed because those suffering wanted the drugs as quickly as possible. Of course, later we learned that some of those drugs actually made things worse, but still, people wanted them NOW.

The same with Ebola, though in the case of Ebola, where testing is extremely difficult, there's some practicality to testing in the field.

The thing with GMOs are that for us to really know the long-term side-effects, we need to get them in a natural environment and treat them like the crops they are. Sadly, that means taking some chances. "

I'm very much interested in the biological basis of when our memory goes awry, so I would appreciate it if you addressed any of these questions to whatever extent you're comfortable with. 

1) What are the molecular changes that may happen in order for a false memory to 'co-opt' and overpower a more accurate, long-term memory or form 'de novo'?

2) What are some of the neurological mechanisms by which memories or thoughts are distorted that often occur in various anxiety disorders? Specifically, what makes these distortions so unrealistic yet believable in the mind of the sufferer?

Uranium is almost ubiquitous in the environment. All unrefined combustibles contain and release it. All heavy metals mining and refining releases it. *Dirt* contains uranium and releases radon (a radioactive and carcinogenic gas) as a uranium decay product. The fact that the nuclear power industry mines, transports and refines uranium ore - and all of these release uranium into the environment - but the ""power plants"" use the refined products in a sealed, highly-controlled process? That's the ""fact"" this article uses to tar (sic) coal industry emissions. Coal sucks on a hundred levels as a pollutant. But uranium emissions are a minor, *slight* sin of that industry.

science,"I've always thought something similar to this. Once you get married, it becomes a big thing for one of the spouses to leave the other, there's court, telling the families, and even it's even worse if you have kids. On the other hand, if you're just in a long term committed relationship, there's nothing really stopping one person from stepping out. In my opinion, this can shape the relationship to where the couple is still ""dating"" in the committed relationship and therefore are still taking the time to learn about one another, make new experiences, and take care of themselves for each other. Whereas a marriage can sometimes be taken for granted, because like you said, ""you've won."""

A sequel does not necessarily continue a narrative. It can continue to develop themes, characters, setting or round out events. A series of detective novels might feature separate plots and narratives only connected by a reoccuring protagonist, for instance.

He refused to let her drive (despite her buying a car) because he wanted to be her sole source of transportation, which made her late to work everyday. Really crazy the amount of control some people want to exert.

Williams has been relieved of duty while an investigation into the command climate is completed, according to the Navy.

Capt. Anthony L. Simmons relieved Cmdr. Curtis B. Calloway **at sea** Tuesday, according to a news release from U.S. Fleet Forces Command.

Calloway; Cmdr. Ed Handley, the former executive officer; and Command Master Chief Travis Biswell have all been assigned to the staff at Naval Surface Force Atlantic pending the investigation.

The destroyer left Norfolk on May 30 for an eight-month deployment."
worldnews,"&gt;Uhhh. hum. A software, yeah.

I see now you don't understand what a true AI is.

&gt;Not necessarily. If you go for a strictly unmodified dumped human ghost just dropped on a computer, okay. it's like saying ""if you are sentiant you MUST have two hands and two arms and only one body and be identically to humans and..."". Noop. This is a Homo Sapiens added characteristic, not a sentient indispensable one; sorry.

... To be sentient you must be able to think. To think you need a theory of mind. If you do not have a theory of mind it is impossible for you to achieve sentience."
worldnews,"I said specific atrocities are mentioned but I failed to mention it is in the WW2 unit, which covers the events more broadly. I only mentioned those atrocities since that is the biggest accusation made to Japan, that they fail to mention such things and in fact is what the person I was responding to said. 

As for high school, I don't know what's taught. I did not go to high school in Japan, just the reason why it's sidelined in importance. I'm not defending it and I've said before that I'm not happy about it.

iama,"Hey Boys,

Big fan from Newfoundland here. I just wanted to ask you guys what your thoughts are on how Trailer Park Boys has really taken off? I mean, I can remember being in like grade 7 and watching the early seasons on showcase, it was a great laugh. 

Just recently I went to the US and whenever I was buying booze or anything and had to present my ID people would come at me with TPB references and shit, it's like a Canadian symbol now, what are you feelings on this?

PS: Also heard Pat was from NL, what's the deal with that?"
worldnews,"I did see the maps, and honestly it shocked me. If I was planning a trip and found that the flight would go anywhere near there I'd nope the hell out.

&gt;Even then, it would take incredible incompetence to mistake a passenger jet for a military one.

A tragic mistake that has been made in the past by major militaries. It would not surprize me if the rebels take shots at any aircraft they can target, under the assumption that they're Ukranian military. I believe in the past the rebels have declared a no-fly zone over the area, which of course the world ignored as it would legitimize the rebels - however, I would hope that for airlines their main concern would be the safety of their passengers, and that they would voluntarily divert around such hotspots."
iama,"&gt; The UK and France really can't do much compared to the US in this circumstance and their influence doesn't carry as much weight.

Only part where I disagree. France in particular has been pretty successful militarily recently (Libya, Mali, CAR). Furthermore, they do have stronger links in Syria then either the US and UK. France supposedly had planes on the runway ready to go. The French public supported strikes more then the American public, the Socialist Party membership in particular wanted cruise strikes. 

The UK is pretty sapped, however they have extremely good intelligence sources. I think it was more about moral support from the UK then anything. In my opinion, Cameron failing to deliver the Parliament vote for precision strikes  kneecapped Obama. I doubt he would have went to Congress had the British approved strikes.

Anyways, hope that makes sense. Its late and I just had a 4+ hour class."

Yes, it can be difficult to establish oneself in one's chosen field, but if you have interesting ideas, publish in respected journals, and give lots of conference papers, you can essentially burst onto the scene and establish yourself fairly quickly, given the proper circumstances.

Having two professors in one home can lead to interesting discussions, not least over the veracity of the Trojan Horse!

askreddit,"I don't quite remember the name of the show because it was like 10 years ago. Basically, my family was at a trip to the aquarium and some lady in uniform asked one of my siblings to plug up a hole in the lining of one of the tanks while she got the repair kit. We were left alone, my sibling holding their hand over the tiny hole. Eventually, another person came by and asked what we were doing. They yelled at us and told us we were going to be thrown out because we had damaged the tank. My mom fought with them for a while then they revealed the hidden cameras and told us it was a prank. 

EDIT: I'm pretty sure the show was called Skunked TV. I've found episode lists, but no good videos. "
iama,"I think cameras keep both the officer and ciziten safer, the ACLU has filed a lawsuit against body cam use due privacy concerns, but it will likely be shot down. 

As far as police brutality, I've seen most of the newer videos.  I don't like to second guess officers usually but each party involved has the ability to escalate or de-escalate the situation.  Not knowing when to use each tactic puts both parties in unreasonable risk. Police would find themselves in much less hot water if they tried a slightly more relaxed approach. Don't bark orders when you exit your vehicle.  This creates a tension that can quickly result in unwanted behavior.  Each situation is different and sometimes screaming is necessary.  I don't think brutality per capita is increasing, the coverage of it is, whether good or bad. "

&gt;This study finds that approximately 117 neonatal circumcision-related deaths (9.01/100,000) occur annually in the United States, about 1.3% of male neonatal deaths from all causes.

However, it is not **just** about the health risks associated with these barbaric acts, it is also the fact that these children do not even get to choose. I would be fine with female circumcision and male circumcision if **only** it was completely voluntary. "
iama,"Well, i cant find any sources on it, but generally speaking, no. In recent years we have had a large spike in *organised* crime with the Bikies, Meth Labs and old Coke runners, but random acts of violence are incredibly rare. Most gun violence that occurs inside the cities is between drug cartels or bikie gangs attacking each other, rather than random people. 

And even then, there are massive police operations removing illegal firearms from the streets of at least my city (Perth) going on right now. Reports claim that they are seizing hundreds of illegal guns, bricks of cocaine and shutting down meth labs every month. Even if crime was rising, it wont be rising for long. "
iama,"There's been a ton of new cars in the city in the last year.

Everyone is responsible for keeping the public areas in front of their home / work clean, and a lot of time gets spent on that.  Whenever you drive through the city you'll see people cleaning the public areas - they like to dig up stretches of grass, sift the dirt, set it on fire to kill any weeds growing in it, and then re-plant it.  That activity seems to take up a huge amount of time in the summers.

The city felt like a city for the most part.  The construction was very 'soviet' for the most part, and the streets were super wide for the amount of cars. Lots of public areas (parks, playgrounds) which is hard to complain about."

iama,"There are laws being pushed to make Neonicotinoid pesticides banned in Canada and US now, some countries have already banned them in European Union. So far the preliminary effects of the bans are hard to determine since its been an abnormal growing season almost everywhere and as such we can't really compare it as well to previous years, but there has been a slight dip in yields. In the long run it shouldn't be too bad though as firms are already developing new technologies (dust deflectors on seeddrills) and new pesticides that should be more forgiving to bees and still get the job done. Also, GMO's really do help with the bee issue, as they have led to a massive (think almost 80%) reduction in the use of insecticides, and while herbicides and fungicides are up in use this is still a massively important factor as bees were very susceptible to insecticides in particular (makes sense right).

I'm not looking to push the limits, and am usually put off by someone being drunk. Obviously it's a judgement call on how they're acting, but I think it would be good to have a general guideline to protect people from getting raped because the more sober party was mistaken about consent.

But we haven't.  There is no violence.  There are no deaths.  There are no protests in Crimea against the Russian army's presence there.  Don't you think that's a little more than ironic?

That's not to say there are no protests - there are in fact protests in Crimea between pro-independance and pro-russian  protesters.  However right now, nobody in Crimea is fighting to stay within the Ukraine. or even protesting the Russian army's presence.

iama,"Wrong direction. Move it DOWN. The reason is that if you introduce hitting at an older age, the kids are bigger and there is a larger size difference in the players. Some players hit puberty at 12, some hit it at 14. If you have a 100 lb kid hitting a 60 lb kid, there is going to be a higher chance of injury. But if you moved the age to 9 or 10, then you'll have a 50 lb kid hitting another 50 lb kid.

Also, you have to teach players at a YOUNGER age HOW to check properly. You shouldn't allow older kids to be taught the wrong way AND have such a weight and height difference. You are just asking for trouble. I've witnessed this issue first hand.

science,"You clone in the cDNA of the RNA you wish to produce after a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, digest the plasmid so that it terminates where the polymerase should end, and then purify the linear DNA, , apply to a T7 in vitro RNA transcription reaction.  The product is treated with DNAse and purified on glass pack columns and eluted in nuclease free water with RNase inhibitors (optional).  Depending on the purpose, the ambion kits are OK.  Using a separate G capping reaction for mmRNAs  is best.  Substituting methyl cytosine and pseudo uridine for the monomer bases in the reaction (C, U) you will have a less immunogenic molecule to transfect.

This is different from how IDT would produce RNAs. "

The point simply is, I'm not aware of **any** country in the world that doesn't have legally-enforced dress standards of some type.  And it's very hard to argue that ""It's OK to force people to cover up X, but immoral to force them to cover up Y"" without ultimately falling prey to serious cultural relativism.

In the same way that the Organics lines from places like Wal Mart and Target have tanked in a major way, I think there's a lot of suspicion that large companies just don't know how to do it 'right' any more, or have a genuine interest in capturing values-driven consumers.

Now I have no business market because there is an infinitely cheaper product which performs the exact same function and provides a very similar experience. Now your stealing, and now I'm the victim."

In regards to Australian media / television and writing, what do you believe we're lacking? If you compare us to the BBC, or even American television - we are horrendously poor. Do you think it's because we've got lacking standards of writing? Or that we're just very different to the rest of the world?

Scott and jay came to me a bout 4 years ago and asked me about joining the team.  Scott and I go back almost 23 years ago when I brought him on board at Interplay. As it was I was getting tired of playing some of the political games in corporation as well as jumping through hoops to do anything.  One would think that 20 years and a bunch of hits would count for something but more often than not it was treated like it was your first rodeo. Going back to a small dev was really attractive to me.  When I started at interplay they were still a dev and I was employee #26. OK enough rambling from me on this

I do get attacks often but after spending an entire year in and out of the hospital, it settled a bit and now I just really have to be careful about what I eat. If I set it off, I have to cut my food to a minimum or just not at all to give it a rest. It's scary because I get dehydrated extremely quickly and can lose several pounds in a matter of days. Delicate balance. Good luck to you as well! "

The flowers are picked in season and (I assume) dried for use when necessary.

Also, in traditional Chinese herbal use, very few herbs are used on their own - they are most often combined into formulae with other ingredients.  And ""tea"" is a bit misleading as these aren't a simple steeping of a herb for flavour like you might make mint or lemon tea as a refreshing drink.  The formula would usually be ""decocted"" - boiled for a long time and drunk in prescribed portions daily.  They usually taste horrible. "

todayilearned,"As far as I know these traces of coke have been found in mummies once brought to Germany. 

However, about the time that egyptology was on the rise, coke was too. And I am not speaking about the 90s (or whenever it was/is) nowadays, I'm talking about the 1800s. Back in the day when the monarchs of Europe lived in palaces of gold, built rooms full of chinese furniture, had black servants (something rather exotic in Europe compared to the US) and fought for having a mummy decorate their living room, they also experimented with coke. It is surprising as to how wild and ""indecent"" they actually got sometimes (some palaces actually had a ""lust pavilion"" on their turf) considering how stuck up they apparently where usually. It is not too far fetched to assume that they were snorting of the bandages of their mummies or - at least - check out their mummies while doing coke.

Kinda like just flat calling someone a ""psychopath"", for example. A nice, slick way to deny them their humanity, say they embody ""psychopathy"" and nothing else, and imply that a ""real"" human would never do the things that these managers do. But I guarantee you that's what is happening. "

absolutely! and this is why an allergy to eggs is a conta-indication to receiving the flu vaccine. I remember listening to a talk by a pharmaceutical company that produces a flu vaccine - I can't remember how many fertilised eggs they use but its huge. 

Making the flu vaccine is an amazing achievement. The producers have to decide in advance which of the strains of flu in circulation are most likely to be a problem several months later. Then they have to co-ordinate a massive production process to make an enormous amount of vaccine. And all this for only a few dollars per shot. Vaccines are amazing.

science,"&gt; In more recent times, they've created ""terminator seeds,"" seeds which result in sterile plants, so that farmers cannot regrow crops and are forced to purchase more seeds from Monsanto, or purchase a special compound that allows the plants to produce further seeds.

Terminator seeds have never been commercialized and Monsanto has pledged never to commercialize them in the future. In addition, people rarely save seeds because you lose the benefits of your particular hybrid strain. It ends up being way more economical to rebuy seeds even if your plants are fertile.

science,"From a limited scan it doesn't seem like this is too revolutionary. It's not far-fetched to reach the conclusion that a mutation in a vital post-transcriptional modification process can lead to immunity from several viruses that use the host's own protein synthesis machinery to propagate. These glycans are often an integral part of cellular signalling, so if there's difficulty in processing their production, it's unlikely the virus will be able to function correctly.

Prophet Muhammad’s inauguration of wholesale enslavement of non-Muslims for selling them or engaging in household work and concubinage was progressively expanded after his death as the Muslim power progressively increased through the reigns of the Rightly Guided Caliphs (632–60), the Umayyads (661–750) and the Abbasids (751–1250)."""
todayilearned,"Wrong. There are [persistent chemical warfare agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare#Persistency). Late in the Cold War studies showed that these could linger for years in areas not directly exposed to rain (eg the underside of a bench). As the Russian plan for WWIII was for massive use of chemical warfare agents against urban and industrial targets this would have presented a major problem.

Also, many chemical warfare agents are either toxic in minute quantities or break down into toxic compounds which means they could easily render an area unsuitable for agriculture and potentially for habitation (eg dry soils where the agents will regularly become airborne).

Nuclear weapons are less of a hazard than most chemical warfare agents, which is why the US and Russians disposed of most of their stockpile."

Wrong. NATO is a defensive alliance, not a peacekeeping force.

Said country is no member of NATO, and thus NATO has no obligations towards it. Said revolution is also rather unpopular in one half of the country.

No NATO member is involved in the current crisis, and let's all hope it stays that way.

On my chicken, I rub the bird with wishbone Italian dressing, above and under the skin, and cover the whole thing with Greek seasoning. I use cavendars at home but we have a special concoction in the store. Cook it until it reads 165 in the thickest part of the breast.

worldnews,"&gt; considering they still haven't made Russian a legal language

Russian is a legal language. You won't get arrested for speaking Russian, Korean or what not. Well, in East of Ukraine you could get arrested or tortured for speaking Ukrainian, and in Crimea you could get beat up for speaking Ukrainian, but that's a separate topic.

Russian is also the lingua franca language in East of Ukraine. Has been and will be.

The whole Russian language issue is likely completely overblown.

Same as in Baltic states, Russian language is supposedly an issue, but in every shop I walk in I can speak Russian freely. In fact, in many I cannot speak Latvian, because the shop-keeper only speaks Russian."
worldnews,".... I think what /u/boskee was getting at is that, it's a fairly widely held belief that the ""rebels"" in the eastern part of the Ukraine are Russian soldiers.  If the SAM systems were Russian, or even captured Ukrainian, and Russian forces are in the eastern part of the Ukraine, it does not matter that the Russian border is 40 miles away.  In other words the range and operating of the SAM isn't important, but WHOM is doing the operating.

todayilearned,"&gt;that doesn't and shouldn't diminish their works in my opinion

It's not possible to *entirely* divorce a work from its author. If a racist writes a book, and includes black people, those black people are going to be depicted in a racist way. Lovecraft's ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" featured man-fish creatures as a specific warning against interracial breeding; that's not even getting into the entire genre of ""mighty whitey"" pulp novels.

Now of course you can say ""oh but I just like the setting for what it is"", but again, the setting exists as it was created. If there is a setting where brave white heroes are running around killing monstrous subhumans, *maybe* stop and think about it for a second. Maybe ""the author being racist"" is kind of an important point in that equation, and *maybe* the fact that you enjoy it so much should make you think about your own values."

To say that the united states is the only state with the capability to end all life via nuclear strikes is also not true. 

You're argument is invalid because your premises don't necessarily lead to the conclusion that the US, or anyone for that matter, is the largest war machine in human history just because of nuclear power. 

It also ignores the very important historical timeline. The Canadian army has guns, whose killing power far over matches that of swords and spears, does that mean that Canada is more of a war machine than the Persian empire under xerxes? No, I don't think so.

The reason they pay people to do it is because the business will fail in competition with another business if they do not.  That's why businesses require degrees or some sort of proof of competency.

science,"This technique looks really promising. There are a number of metabolic rare diseases that involve small mutations in specific genes for enzymes that don't require much activity to correct the problem. For a lot of these metabolic diseases the specific mutation or at least the gene is known. With this technique it looks like it would be relatively easy to sequence the gene in the patient to find the mutation and generate a specific repair. It looks like it will work mostly only for introducing repairs in the liver, but a lot of these metabolic disorders only need the the activity somewhere in the body, not necessarily in the organ it's normally expressed in. So it likely wont matter if the gene is only active in the liver."

In a first past the post system, voting for the lesser of the two left parties is a not only throwing your vote away, it's is actually causing the party on the right to win. After the election we see that the two left parties each got 30% of the vote, and the right party got 40%. More people expressed interest in seeing a party on the left elected, yet the right won. The two major parties when in power decide to stack the system such that they will continue to win. How is that not oppression?"

At one of the existing predefined start points, insert the code you want for the protein you want. your endpoint is before the start point for the next sequence so as long as the heilacase or whatever doesnt start in the middle (which would be bad even if the dna wasnt modified) you wont get any unknown protiens.

The argument I have against Hitler being objectively bad is that morals aren't objective, but instead highly personal and a signal of the age and location of where you grew up. If you grew up as a patrician in the Roman Empire you'd think that having slaves was perfectly normal and that crucifying people was too. Would you agree to that now?"
askreddit,I think one season per era is a bit much when talking in terms of Egyptian pharaohs to modern times because your turnover of characters would be too high you would be replacing the entire cast at least twice a season. So the only way you get people to keep watching is a stellar dramatic story or plain history buffs. The better way I think would to focus on a 200year period  like starting at Americas discovery by the English etc and then continue until ww2 that way you can keep some cast around and just age them appropriately.  I think your biggest problem will be sticking to FActs while still telling a story that people will want to watch not to mention having a reasonable budget.

One Malaysian plane full of passengers disappears without a trace. An unprecedented event for this age.

Another Malaysian plane full of passengers crashes:

* on the border of the most heated international conflict of the year

* to be blamed immediately on the Russians, the Western media's current boogeyman

Such a convenient disaster. It literally couldn't have been planned better.

**EDIT** Sorry to hurt your little brains. Surely there is nothing strange about one Malysian plane disappearing without a trace and ""another"" one showing up just in time to provoke an international conflict that was already at its boiling point. Nothing to see here."
iama,"Well, Jeff's character in Iron Man comes to mind. I can't find any interviews off-hand but almost every time an actor is asked about a villainous character they played, they seem to insist the character is not a villain, but really misunderstood, or their motivation was good. ""What was it like playing the bad guy?"" ""Oh I never thought of him as bad, just trying to win the struggle"" or similar.  Like Jeff said we all have good and bad sides, even the real heroes. It is history that defines who the heroes and villains are. "

I mean, modern chutes are small, lightweight and inexpensive - just pop it on as you take your seat, buckle up and if the one in a billion should happen you can jump out.

science,"Dr. Shepherd,

I am a Child and Adolescent psychiatrist in Canada and work in an emergency psychiatric unit, where I often see children and adolescents at the beginning of major diagnoses (scz, BD, etc.)  The life trajectory changes that these disorders cause is incredible.

I often teach my students that there are likely many pathways to psychosis.  Everyone focuses on dopamine which might be a common step, but it is, as defined in DSM, a very heterogeneous condition.  

My questions, as youre an expert in the molecular changes and causes of these conditions:  

1.  What do you see as the next frontier in molecular targets in psychosis,  and 

2. If you had to, in a sentence or two,  explain the cause of schizophrenia... would you use a similar explanation as mine or is there something more concrete to say?"
todayilearned,"That is fascinating! As a feminist I find this inconvenient, but my own experience as the mother of a 6 year old boy concurred. More so as toddlers I noticed that ALL the little girls drew more neatly and ""correctly"" than ALL the little boys. Now it seems at 6 kids just like what they like. My son loves Legos and all ""boy"" toys, but he really doesn't make friends well with boys. He chooses to hang almost exclusively with girls. He's a talker and says they are nicer. He's also a flirt. 

But even if all that you say is true, that male and female brains are typically inherently different, it still seems wise to socialize for equality. Furthermore, perhaps ""feminine"" skills should be as monetarily valued as more ""masculine"" skills. Perhaps the reason teachers and nurses are underpaid is because the fields are full of women.

Honestly, the economy is getting better and jobs are growing, but it's just certain jobs, certain fields.  I guess you have to ask yourself if you are a ""follow your dreams"" type or a ""safety"" type.  If you are concerned about a job, then look at what job type has the most want ads, and learn that career.  However, if you follow your dreams, you my find something worth more than money.

This fact *in no way* justifies or excuses the sort of violent response we see from the zealots who can't stand to see women dressed differently from what they expect.   The problem here is their *response* to people's choice of dress, not the choice of dress itself.

If animals are brightly colored but *not* toxic, and they're in high numbers then yes, this works against you, because now you're easily found and eaten with no concern, so this doesn't evolve in high number.  This is the case that you see with mimic populations.

It's been hugely popular, they had three times more applicants than free places :) They then set up a special intensive programme (in practical nursing) for men, for those who wanted to continue in the field. It was a well advertised campaign, posters all over the place, stating simply that we need more men in healthcare and that it'd be awesome if more would join. Complete with pictures of regular men (not models, I mean) in nursing uniforms - come to think of it, they probably are local nurses who volunteered for the advertising campaign. Pretty cool."

I'm of the opinion that farming subsidies are mostly useless and used as corporate padding, but I urge you to run the numbers yourself (I did once when I was curious, but it's lost in some ancient reddit comment). America's farming industry is immense. Even without any corn subsidies, corn would still be the cheapest crop to grow for animal feed. Simply put, large areas of the US are very well suited for growing corn.

tl;dr people make it sound like subsidies are the reason why corn is cheap, and seem to imply that without the subsidies, other grains would be viable feed. This isn't the case. Even without subsidies, corn would still be cheapest by a wide margin."

There's even a picture from inside a mouse's colon showing where cancerous cells can be detected.  Technically that's inside the critter, but on the surface of a tissue that can be visualized.  

This lets you differentiate normal versus cancerous tissue just by looking at it, which is very hard to do.  Usually you'd have to add in a probe or special chemical (or take cells out and look at them under a microscope) to be able to figure out where the tumor stops and the normal tissue starts, or even if there is a tumor there at all.

todayilearned,"The danger of unconditional cash transfers is that it makes not working a logical choice.  Hypothetically if welfare benefit is $25K and a job earns a person $30K then the marginal income of $5K is too low to justify all that work.  This is not a good outcome because an unemployed person on assistance will never receive a raise like workers do.  Unemployment is also associated with negative health and mental health effects, and the individual will miss out on skills learned on the job.  An unconditional cash transfer may be efficient in the short term but there is a danger it will create this poverty trap over time.  The US constructed its antipoverty programs deliberately to avoid this.  For example the Earned Income Tax Credit supplements the income of low wage jobs, so it creates an incentive to work.  And unemployment assistance has a limited time frame so the recipient has an incentive to find a new job before it runs out."
iama,"I used to think the concept was absurd. I have had other scientists provide a hypothetical mechanism for how a specific type of GMO could cause cancer so I think it's worth looking in to. But I personally think it's a bit of a stretch and there is very little if any evidence to suggest that they pose a cancer risk. 

The other thing about cancer is it's an inevitability of being a alive. The only way to prevent cancer is to die of something else first. So we have to weigh the risks and GMOs pose a very very low risk comared to other things we are exposed to constantly."

I haven't sprayed in about a decade now, and neither myself or anybody that I worked with during this time (over 100 people) has gotten cancer or suffered any ill health from spraying glyphosate, including my former boss who would often drink shots of the stuff to show the rookies that it was safe."

Bills are heavily prioritized,  only the things that matter the most get pushed to the floor (not entirely true,  given that our Speaker is a corrupt asshat)  with so little time,  every day is treated as vital,  and the staff work round the clock getting everything done.  

A staffer for a state legislator here can list those four months as two years worth of political and legislative experience,  and it is completely justified.  "

worldnews,"Reasonable, considering it's a return that they are getting from investing in other companies and projects.

You WANT that income taxed lower, it encourages investment. Last I checked, investment was a good thing

So first they invest money into a company/project that, if succesful, is clearly providing the public some sort of good or service. Then you tax them the same amount when they pull out the profits, so that you can take the tax and invest it in providing a good or service?

That makes no sense"

science,"&gt; In fact, studies with identical twins growing up apart of each found that they still had closely matching IQ. Environment is much less important than genes when it comes to intelligence

And people hate that this is true. I can actually name genetic conditions that affect IQ and people still iinsist it's all environment. There was an interesting study in virtual twins (adopted together in infancy) which found the shared environment had negligible affect on IQ and they had not much more than a random relation to each other.

Another study showed that with siblings, IQ made a massive difference to life outcome (having the same SES and parents).

I think a lot of people don't get that the most critical 'environment' as far as affecting IQ goes is the pre birth one.

This is just a microRNA that bypasses the initial time-consuming steps of generating a target sequence, by which time the viral infection has more of a chance to have taken hold, by having an endogenous microRNA that targets a conserved sequence.

The very same concept is already used to target mRNA in research already, the problem is that it's difficult to get cells to express foreign mRNA constructs as they'll be identified as foreign and rapidly degraded. It is possible to stably express microRNAs but I don't believe it has been optimised as a treatment yet."

It's usually after a long day at work, and I don't feel like taking another half-hour to go back, wait in line again, and drive back home.  So I just eat it as is, it's a bit dry and not perfect, but not terrible by any means.  I just never know what to do.  I feel like I don't have grounds to complain because after all I did eat it, but at the same time I feel like the right thing for Subway would be when I call, they would give me a discount on my next order, that would be my desired outcome.  What would you do in that case?"
iama,"Second this question. Another meal plan option would be amazing. For the past few semesters, I've had to buy two Loyalty 50 plans because I eat a lot on campus, but not enough where a full meal plan would be worth it.

The grocery store problem is really frustrating, too. I wonder if Sodexo has influence on one not coming to campus....they and Marquette do make a lot of money off meal plans.

That gets me thinking...can we audit Sodexo and look the possibility of bringing in another foodservice provider? Their food is not a good value for the price of the meal plans. The quality is less than stellar, too."

It's like you're saying the guy making $180,000 a year isn't much better off than the guy making $30,000 (six times less) a year. 

Also, if a 2 sector farm can survive and be overall profitable over the course of time, then a 12 sector one will be the same, only their loss years will be slightly less, percentage wise, since they get things done, and buy on that bigger bulk discount. "

science,"Anecdotally, not true. I lived in a part of the UK with lots of beef farms and they all allowed their cows to roam freely around a field of grass, something which I believe is quite unusual in the US. The price for your beef being so much cheaper than ours I guess.  
In general I suspect there is not much maize (corn) grown here compared to the US - corn syrup isn't used as a sugar substitute and sweetcorn (corn on the cob) tends to be imported from warmer parts of Europe.

science,"The problem is if you take 10,000 people, with 10 guilty, with 70% accuracy, you declare 3000 people guilty, 7 of whom actually are.  At 90%, you're only up to 9 out of 1,000.  It's very bad as a primary identifier of dishonesty.  

The problem is that even ""high accuracy"" on a population of mostly haystacks and few needles results in mostly false positives to the point of 99.3% at 90%.  

Eye witness testimony, on the other hand is estimated to be the reason for wrongful conviction in 52% of .5% of cases putting it at an accuracy that's actually much higher.  [[1](http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/ronhuff.htm)]

3) Right not Netanyahu is the PM. If under him, he allowed the release of almost one hundred murderers just to talk with the Palestinians, a horrible move, what do you think someone even weaker and more dovish like Livni would do?

iama,"Boy, I had one early on when Lawrence Block was kind enough to mention my writing parody, How To Sell A Gazillion Ebooks (while drunk, high or incarcerated) in the same article as John Locke's how to book. That caused a stir, because the man literally wrote the book on writing. The second was when I ran my first Amazon Select free promotion in January, 2012, and saw 4000 or 5000 sales of Geronimo Breach in the days following it. That gave me a model to follow that I used the hell out of for six months to gain a readership. Definitely a game changer. And the final career-changer was obviously being chosen to co-author with Clive Cussler and being featured in the WSJ, Chicago Tribune and The Times.

TL;DR: This tragedy was always a tragedy before American lives were confirmed lost. Anyone commenting on the American angle is simply wondering if this means Americans would have a bigger incentive to join the fray in a more hands-on manner."
science,"&gt; I would define free will along the lines of: a set of capacities for imagining future courses of action, deliberating about one’s reasons for choosing them, planning one’s actions in light of this deliberation and controlling actions in the face of competing desires.

But is that free will if, given the exact same starting criteria (knowledge, experience, circumstance, stilumi, etc) the individual would always choose the same outcome?

If I ask you to pick 'left' or 'right', and you pick 'up', is that exercising free will by rejecting the terms of the question? Or is it exercising determinism because you, given precisely identical circumstances, would always reject the terms of the question?"
worldnews,"While I don't approve of vigilante justice, I really have no sympathy for someone who  tortured people or designed a torture program. He (and everyone else involved, all the way up the chain of command) deserves to be prosecuted and put in prison for war crimes.

Torturing people directly harmed and killed people. It prevented us from using reliable interrogation techniques, which made it harder to investigate previous crimes and prevent future attacks. It indirectly put people's life in danger because it made people justified in defending themselves against us.

The fact that we tortured people, innocent and guilty alike, that is what put us in danger, the revelation of that fact is the first step in changing the situation, stopping the crime, and making the country safe."

The is a ""forwards from grandma"" that floats around the Web regularly about a mother that insists that a cake has to be baked a certain way.  One day her daughter is baking the cake and mentioned this method to the grand mother.  And grandma explains that she always baked the cake that way because her oven never worked properly and grandpa was too cheap to replace the oven.

iama,"Do you have any thoughts about how the war in Afghanistan is being reported on, from an informational standpoint?

One kneejerk reaction that I have is this: All of coverage is of troops in combat. Which is great, because it reminds Americans what they're asking of their soldiers.

But this means that all the news stories come from where the security situation is poor, thus the need for troops in combat. But I never see stories on quieter regions of Afghanistan (North and West), where the Taliban haven't been for years, and where progress is strong. Thus resulting in an overly pessimistic outlook on Afghanistan by most Americans.

There's only a very tiny fraction of the code that is absolutely essential for the whole thing to work. If you're modifying the code to how your e-mail program works, you usually aren't too worried about crashing your whole computer."
science,"This actually happens. It's more common in Canada than the U.S., but the petrochemical corporations (Monsanto, Dow, DuPont, Syngenta) making patented GMOs have routinely sued farmers successfully for millions because their experts randomly walked onto someone's property/farm, started taking random samples of crops, and if the crops show genetic similarities or patented sequences then they sue the farmer.

These patents don't take into consideration that seeds can blow off delivery vehicles like trucks, insects can cross-pollinate plants for many miles while birds can carry entire seeds, or maybe the wind blows patented pollen or seeds across property lines from one farm that has rights to another that doesn't. It is relevant to note that a large number of GMO crops are single-generation, meaning they don't produce pollen or seeds. Meaning, farmers have to apply for and purchase patented seeds and the rights to grow those seeds every single year.

If the US (or other countries as well, really) is going to have environmental regulation, its not that fair to its own companies if they can just be undercut by overseas competitors or by US companies outsourcing portions of their production overseas to avoid these regulations.

There have been attempts to legislate the conversion before, for example, Congress enacted the Metric Conversion Act in 1975, but the conversion to the metric system was made voluntary. The pharmaceutical industry already use the metric system. The beverage industry has been partially converted. But for the most part, US manufactured goods use the imperial system. The only way to switch the US to the metric system is by Congress enacting a law making the conversion compulsory. Eventually, perhaps soon, with the economic emergence of China, India, Brazil and other countries, the US may not have a choice but to switch if it wants to remain competitive with the rest of the world."

The action taken in Libya only proved that America's European partners are entirely dependent on the United States for logistical support and other aspects of warfare. 

I also think that when France decided not act in Syria also show their reliance on the US. Syria is way too big of an issue for France to tackle without US support militarily. There is more risk in Syria than in Mali or CAR. 

What's most interesting to me is how the events in Libya affected everything from Mali and the CAR to Syria. 

The rebels in Mali and the CAR found most of their weapons in Libya and fighters. Regime change really destabilized the region. 

Libya affected Syria politically in the UN security council. Russia and China do not want to duped again to support regime change with a UN mandate like they did in Libya.  "

I just don't like when people resign to deep learning being the end all be all, so to speak, because it's just one model, and in the words of statistician George E. P. Box, ""Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful."" This isn't to say that neural nets aren't useful! However, you can't just apply them to any old learning task and get 100% accuracy. Also, they aren't often what you want -- one of their big downsides is that they are not very interpretable, so you can't easily tell why your inputs lead to your outputs."
worldnews,"You're missing a key point.

The composition for the 2017 committee is not set in stone. Currently the 1200 committee is not elected at all by the HK people directly and is allocated by quotas in specific sectors. Under the basic law 840 members of the committee could be elected through direct elections based on what happens in the legislative process, which would be a significant improvement over the current nomination system in terms of ""democratic principles"".

Edit: I also read over the comments you linked to and they don't really prove your point that the joint deceleration guarantees any sort of universal suffrage. They mention elections but also mentions that the central government is the body that has ultimate control over who becomes the chief executive."
science,"Yes:

&gt;In fact, a conflict of interest can exist even if there are no improper acts as a result of it. (One way to understand this is to use the term ""conflict of roles"". A person with two roles—an individual who owns stock and is also a government official, for example—may experience situations where those two roles conflict. The conflict can be mitigated—see below—but it still exists. In and of itself, having two roles is not illegal, but the differing roles will certainly provide an incentive for improper acts in some circumstances.)

Ergo the source is not credible. "
iama,"Thanks for this AMA. BEST ONE I have read recently and I kust the absence of circle jerking is refreshing.

The ability of the DPRK government to maintain their control over the population has always fascinated me.

For all those chipping away at your statements I would like to mention that A few years ago I visited Shanghai for several weeks. Experiencing ""communism"" face to face was extremely unusual in the busy urban landscape in that it was very hard to find. Trust me Capitalism is alive and well - in China!

However, when folks at home asked me how ""China"" was I would reply that Shanghai was great but that I know no more about China than a Chinese tourist who visited New York for two weeks can now tell you all about ""America"".

iama,"We have a questionnaire which applicants fill out, which lets us get our head around their case. We cross-reference the questionnaire with legal documents pertaining to their case, particularly legal briefs from both sides from the direct appeal, police reports, and the transcript of expert testimony. After authenticating the information, we begin the next level of review, which consists of asking ourselves two questions: 1) does the applicant have at least a colorable claim of innocence, based upon something objective, and 2) is there a direction to go in which could theoretically lead to uncovering previously unknown evidence of innocence sufficient for us to go into court and argue that they are innocent"

50 hectares harvested an hour by one machine (&gt;300,000kg of grain aka several million loaves of bread).

If you can find a way to do hugelkultur in a remotely similar fashion then that is ok. Otherwise it is more of a hobby than food production.

todayilearned,"No. This TIL is innacurate. People were often already in prison when inquisitors arrived, other cases were tried and resolved via slow written correspondence, and yet other people were tried in absentia. During the 1200s in the Albigensian Crusade, a group of purist Christians called Cathars were rooted out of Southern France. Tens of thousands were slaughtered, expelled, or blinded. Inquisitors accompanied the Papal armies and the killers were granted absolution from the rapes and murders in advance."

worldnews,"Eh, it's the same as any profit-minded corporation.  They try to maximize their revenue, and minimize their costs, which maximizes their profit.  Also they need to try to remain competitive with other firms which requires them to keep their prices down (or their customers who are also minimizing their costs will shop elsewhere), which makes minimizing their pay-outs even more important.

It's horrible and one could probably argue quite unethical, but if you eliminate the human-factor, it's a perfectly rational and a smart business decision.

As far as trust goes, basically all insurers act the same way, so if you want insurance (and any chance of compensation in case of major loss) you're going to have to accept it, and the customers who make claims are the ones the insurance company wants least to keep, so at that point they have no intensive to do anything to try to retain them. "
todayilearned,"Now you're arguing about something completely different. ""Statists"" do not think the state is always right, as you said.

And yes, what about the individuals? How do the individuals get their share of the world's mines, farms, forest, fisheries, and city-space? How can the multi-million dollar block of land with a supermarket down the road from me become the completely unrestricted privat property of a single coporation without disenfranchising all the othe individuals? How can the mineral wealth of a nation fall in to private hands without disenfranching the individuals of that nation? How can farmland falling into private ownership be thought of as anything but theft from starving individuals?

worldnews,"As for NATO involvement, I think it will come down to the number of people on the plane who were citizens of NATO countries. Also, the tone that the Novorussians and Russian nationals use when addressing this will be a major factor. If they admit mistakes were made, nothing will come of it. However, if they continue their saber rattling and escalation of the local conflict, I fear western european and north american militaries will feel they have to involve themselves.

I agree that I hope I'm wrong about all of this, but a continued dialog is the most important part of avoiding all of this. Nothing will cause escalation faster than ending the conversation. "
worldnews,"Pakistani here. From what I've read about Turkey in this thread, I think Pakistan is similar. In large cities like Karachi and Lahore, majority are from 4 to 6. I really doubt the results this survey because Pakistan really isn't that conservative.

iama,Tony Hawk! I'm a huge fan of your work on and off the board. We met for a bit at the Chelsea Piers Skatepark in nyc when you were filming a deodorant commercial a few years back. It was early and the park was pretty much empty aside from you and the film crew. The PA's were trying to keep us out of the park but you made it clear that it was fine for us to skate while you guys filmed. That morning my friend and I got to skate with Tony Hawk. A dream of mine since playing those first two minute runs in the warehouse level on the THPS demo disc. Thanks for that Tony! And thanks for all of the great work you continue to do through your foundation. 
todayilearned,"&gt;IIRC he wanted a system where a king ruled with absolute power, but did little with it outside of war times. 

Such a ruler would naturally be housed in a great tower.  

Because he's so benevolent, he'd probably build his tower on land no one else could use.  A volcanic wasteland would be a good choice.

And he'll need servants to oversee the kingdom's day-to-day functions.  Perhaps nine of them.  They should all bear a symbol of the king's authority.  Nothing gaudy... a simple ring perhaps."
iama,"Sure, I can see that too- which is why as states legalize they're almost guaranteed to include language in the new laws about only smoking on private property or in designated smoking areas.  Legalizing in Florida would by no means necessitate families having to usher their children through a gauntlet of pot smokers on the way into or out of parks, restaurants, hotels, etc.  

My point is not at all that parents should be OK with their kids being around pot (although how many parents take their kids to restaurants where people are drinking?  But that's a dfferent argument I suppose).  My point is that legalizing recreational smoking doesn't seem likely at all to me to have any sort of meaningful impact on a state's non-pot related tourism industries.

EDIT: tiepoe."
worldnews,"&gt; I'm just hoping that it wasn't shot down, since that would escalate a conflict that is already bad and does not need escalation.

On the other hand, if NATO gets involved, it could end up helping to resolve that conflict and ultimately save lives.

&gt; There is another coincidence, same airline and same plane that crashed a few months ago, the MH370.

Yes... just a coincidence.  No reason to blame the airline.  We don't even know what happened to MH370... 

&gt; For the people on board and their families, it doesn't really matter. It's horrible either way. T_T

I agree.  All around horrible and tragic.  I'm only saying it's not reasonable and not fair to make it worse for the airline, when it does not seem to be their fault.

iama,"&gt;  The US is a country that treats its poor people horribly without any real justification or need to.

One could argue Americans in the upper end of the lower class to the lower end of middle class get the ""worst"" treatment from the government.  
For the very poor, the government provides section 8 (housing vouchers), ""food stamps"", free healthcare through Medicaid, grants for upper education, etc.

These entitlements have income limits that, depending on family size, can exclude the lower middle class.  Leaving them in a position of not having the income to purchase goods/services independently, yet having too much income to qualify for governmental assistance."
science,"Fair enough. : P

I dunno, man, different strokes. I'd venture that most of the time when kids ""kill dreams,"" it's because they were conceived accidentally. (Not to say that either one implies the other, just that it seems reasonable you'd find a correlation.) If someone's ready for it and decides to have a kid, being a successful parent is their aspiration, y'know? Just as you're eschewing having a kid so you can chase a dream like being a professional bodybuilder, they're choosing to eschew going to the gym so they can raise children they can be proud of.

worldnews,"No. ATC has 100% control for where an aircraft is to fly through.

todayilearned,"Right, as someone in the middle class should be capable of having a family.

&gt;Middle class is the class of people centered around the median wage, and as the purchase power of median wage fluctuates so does the standard of living of the middle class.

You can define middle class that way, but the other meaning, the one where it represents a standard of living, is what I meant. It's the way the term is usually used, and would make the most sense in this context. When you want to talk about median wage, you usually refer to it specifically."
askreddit,"Whilst I agree there is a difference, I also believe there are 2 types of rape fetishists: those who like the power and those who focus on the trust, as you said.

Those people perhaps seek a more 'realistic' experience and act on it illegally where other rape fetishists would not.

The idea is to create a community where local hosts and travelers can meet:
- hosts have a little space at home and are willing to keep someone's luggage for a few days or a few hours, in exchange for a little money (something like $10 a day or less, it is up to the host to choose)
- travelers can look over the website to find a space available near the location where they're headed. So they can drop their luggage and then are able to visit the city or commute without carrying their luggage everywhere.

It is a win-win relationship as everyone gets satisfied and in the meantime, you as a traveler can meet a local person, which is always good when you're new :) Please watch this 1-min video explaining the concept briefly: http://vimeo.com/106224013"

In the draft era, the only difference among men was household drug use, in which men with a history of military service had a significantly lower prevalence than men without a history of military service (2.1% vs 3.3%; P = .003).

Yes it's largely dairy cattle that eat silage; but they do so their entire lives, making it just as common way of feeding cattle corn than just the kernels."

Having said that though, what they did was horrific, and no amount of lack of parental guidance justified what they did. So I completely agree with they got the punishment they did.

I have to thank you.  I was getting concerned that nobody was falling into the trap of calling me ""entitled"", since it's such an obvious mistake for people to make in this situation, and I was anticipating the response.

It's not about entitlement.  I don't feel I deserve to watch whatever SNL videos I want whenever I want.  NBC can do whatever they want.

I'd say give drug companies a 2 year monopoly on new drugs, but force them to sell at production cost to patients who cannot afford life/quality of life saving treatments, and then after 2 years allow generics on everything.

That'll force innovation into high gear, and stop the huge stagnation bias of ""well, this drug has 17

science,"I can't speak to the cases in OP's study, but I was part of some immunology research at the NIH roughly ten years ago. To the best of my knowledge my being a Mosaic and a somewhat unique case made me somewhat inapplicable for their study.

At any rate, I can confirm that I have a mutation in the NEMO gene (Xq28) which yields many symptoms of Ectodermal Dysplasia/Incontinentia Pigmenti. It also affects white blood cells, though (misshapen). And makes me *more* susceptible to many forms of infection (e.g. herpes encephalitis). 

The only reason I mention this at all is that I seem remarkably resistant to influenza. The test I was part of was looking at white blood cell *counts* and bone marrow density (both were good/high), so I really have no idea if there is other immunities."
worldnews,"I'm not convinced the same blind, reflexive faith in the value of diversity is best applied to fundamentalist, chauvinist, separatist religion. Tolerance has worked pretty well in the context of post-Enlightenment culture in the West, with the possible exception of enabling Israel's notably ghastly behavior, resulting from the fundamentalist chavanism driving its domestic and foreign policy.

We may need to forge a third way. Islam presents more of a challenge to the fundamental fabric of Enlightenment culture than people who vote left, eat organic food and wear recycled clothing. We may need to take some concrete steps to establish assimilation as more than simply our desire. In the long run, coercion in this regard may be less of a slippery slope toward authoritarianism than a bulwark against it. "
iama,"Good afternoon, Mr. Gatiss. I have to say that although I don't really know all of your work (non-British), I really admire what I've seen and I think you're a remarkable actor and writer. I have a few questions, maybe you could answer some of them:

1. Sherlock Holmes is regarded by some as the oldest modern fandom. What does it feel to know that your work is helping to keep alive such a wonderful character AND that you're interpreting the smartest human in fiction?

2. How badly did you want to become a Doctor Who writer, and what have been the best parts of it?

3. Is there any fun story you'd like to share about the production of either show?

By the way, I can't wait for tomorrow's episode.

Thanks for reading!

The same goes for biological warfare,  I dont think countries will risk it coming back to their population...  Because that's what I would do if I were a country that got bioweapons used on me...  I'd send some ""refugees""  back to the country I'm fighting against,  or to an adjacent country at least.

That is quite similar, only the good/service is being provided by the government rather than a private institution."

So the law still applies, but prosecutors got directive that if weed possessor has small amount and wasn't prosecuted before, they have to let him go. And this happened in a country where over 90% (ninety!) of people declare to be catholics, ergo weed is commonly considered as devil thing.

science,"Many creationists I know ha e brought to my attention what they call irreducible complexity in advanced organisms. The basics of this thought is that in many animals there are organisms that can not be simplified and still function, therefor leading to the assumption that such a trait could not have evolved over time nor is there sufficient chance that the same mutation Could have happened in both a male and female allowing said trait to carry on in the race. Two examples of this are the valve system in a giraffes neck, and the explosive defense mechanism in the bombardier beetle. How would one respond to such claims as this? Do we have an explanation yet for how such characteristics could have evolved?"

I would like to add, since I'm unsure how you view my stance on that thought process (of spending money when you get it) that I don't endorse that line of thinking. It's an unfortunate byproduct of the mentality that comes from being broke, which as you said is short sided.

I myself have been very lucky to not end up in any debt. My schooling was paid for, and I have always had a good grasp of personal finance. I was also lucky enough to get a well paying job after moving out from home. Now I'm single, getting laid off, and have over 35k in the bank.

Secondly, I was wondering if you have any advice for aspiring writers? I know that you might be too busy answering all the other awesome questions but as a teenager who loves writing (but is nonetheless lazy and never finishes any of her works), do you have any advice for getting inspiration and how to overcome writer's block? 

Lastly, you are a very cool human being in general.

If they don't want to be diagnosed, they won't, if they do want a diagnosis, they will.  One might as well just ask if they want a manic-depressive diagnosis.

Also, even without intent, the questions use the patient's viewpoint.  A person who isn't depressed can easily, sincerely say ""my future is hopeless, and I've been feeling this way for weeks"" because they're upset about their student loans.  But that doesn't prove the feeling and the pathological behavior of depression.  Without shutting one's self off from the world, thoughts of self-harm, and being unable to function, it's not really ""depression"".

When I would lose, I would simply refocus completely on the next appeal. Consequently, my last 5 years, when I didn't have any appeals left, was the hardest time."
iama,"Interesting!  I’m dating myself, but about 1 year after I returned from SE Asia in 1968, I began reading everything with a totally different perspective.  Didn’t take too long to separate the wheat from the chaff, i.e. media coverage, etc., and have been basically accumulating “post SEA” experience on a few continents and have arrived at the same place I was in 1968.  And, with that note, that’s why I have all of your books, with the exception of the Jet series and Black.  I held off until this week, and ordered the first 4 Jet books.  I’m looking forward to my journey through this series.  Thanks again, and I have more than what you require for refreshments should you come up north.  Might even go out on the lake and just troll for those BA lake trout, salmon, etc. and a belly full of BS! "
worldnews,"Ecology grad student here. Maybe this is the cure for the glut of biology PhDs that are being produced with so few PhD level jobs out there (I understand you micro folks have it worse than us.). I've heard people with more experience than me suggest that part of the reason is that PIs need lots of grad students toiling away in order to keep publishing.

Maybe with increased automation, PIs will rely less on grad students as ""science laborers"", and thus be less likely to take on more students than they should."
iama,"I know she's young, but as a person with some serious physical limitations due to a spinal injury myself, might I suggest (if the option is available) to try something like kayaking.  It's a very low impact form of exersize &amp; recreation.  You are mostly working your arms &amp; shoulders, so the spine isn't pivoting back and forth constantly like it would be switching paddling sides constantly in a canoe, and it is mostly (unless you frequent very populated rivers/lakes) a very quiet &amp; peaceful sport with few people around.  I find it very relaxing and mentally uplifting to just be out on the water enjoying what nature has to offer."
iama,"We actually are just now replacing the well pump. we've seen over a 20 foot drop in water depth on our well since the previous owner installed it in the mid 90's. all our plants and trees are on a drip system to prevent water loss. We also are experimenting with several localized, low water crops and vegetation to not have to be as impacted by the drought. Our water use is somewhere around 300 gallons a day right now.

We too are now having issues regarding water and water rights regarding farm sales. Personal well limits of 1600 gallons per day, but if we sell anything without commercial water rights we could be fined. We are trying to figure out what to do from here and focusing on building up the infrastructure.

science,"And clergy. I read in a book that you find them at the top of these three areas. In religion, the people around them often want to see the best in everyone. Therefore they are easy to fool. The book I read is The Sociopath Next Door. I recommend it. Our minister just left (moved up to a bigger church) and I am convinced he was one. He worked 20 hours a week tops. He did a bad job and people assumed he did not know what he was doing and needed guidance. He knew exactly what he was supposed to do and chose not to do it. When challenged, he would appear either hurt or angry, whichever one would make the person back off."

iama,"When I began posting on YouTube (2006), I did so because I loved video, and wanted to share 'em with my friends. The Microwave Show picked up in 2007, and we started seeing financial success via our audience on a short-lived site called Flix55.com -- where they awarded a $50 prize to the top videos each day. Leveraging our small YouTube crowd of a few thousand subscribers, we handily won that prize like 3x a week... it wasn't full-time money, but it was a great start that off-set all the costs of production.

Later, in January of 2008, YouTube opened their Partner Program to the first few hundred channels, and I was invited. I got my first check the next month for around $800, and knew immediately that this could be a career if I dedicated myself to it."
askreddit,"Just old sporting injuries until one day I rolled my ankle, heard the crack, went to hospital, they told me i just sprained it... 6 weeks later it was still no better, saw My GP, sent me off for more scans. I then had an Ankle arthroscopy and it turned out i had broken My ankle and the surrounding tendons and ligaments. Part of the ankle bone had slithered off ad had re wedged itself inside the ankle joint.

due to the trauma in the area the ligaments etc started to 'dissolve'

I currently have about 8 screws and 3 plates in my ankle.

The specialists have suggested that I would have greater mobility if i was to have it amputated and had use of a prosthetic, not that they would do that and of course that is a drastic step that I won't consider"
askreddit,"Electricity.

The feeling of a small amount of electricity running through me is just amazing. Whenever my dad goes to recharge a large battery, he leaves it on a piece of wood to keep too much charge from going straight into the ground. I always go barefoot when that happens, as the wood has just enough resistance to let a small amount go into the ground. Just enough to feel, but not enough to hurt.

It's a feeling that's hard to describe. It doesn't hurt like if you stuck something in an outlet, but it feels similar. Really odd and I love it."
iama,"I don't know specifically about troubled teen programs in other countries that are not specifically for American teenagers (except in Canada, I am aware of several Canadian programs that are similar to Escuela Caribe). I would imagine that many other countries have places like this if there are no safeguards in-place to monitor them. I think wherever you find parents that are desperate to help their kids you'll find people who want to make money off of them. The key is to make sure that these facilities are not abusive and that only kids who really need in-patient treatment are sent away from their homes.  "
iama,"Tough one. I would say no goal. Reasoning: You outstretched your arm and the puck hit your hand. If your hand was on your stick, I'd say a good goal. If you intentionally use your hand to deflect a puck into the goal, the goal should not count, even if your hand was not in motion. If the puck hit your arm, it's a good goal.

The main issue here is was your hand in motion. TECHNICALLY speaking, if your hand wasn't moving AT ALL IN ANY WAY, it's a good goal. But I would probably say that I would have disallowed the goal based on you moving your entire arm and your hand was used in deflecting the puck into the goal."
science,"&gt;completely normal things

What does this even mean?

Splicing genes from one organism into another is not 'completely normal' by any standard. The risks associated with doing major intervention at a genetic level with the things we eat and changing our pesticide practice by what that allows us to do are in no way comparable to your other examples.

It's this attitude towards powerful technology that scares me. Nuclear, GMO's would be fine in the hands of an intelligent species. Really not sure homosapiens count as that."

My dad sued him and won and whatever the insurance issued back then in the 80's basically claimed almost everything he got in the lawsuit to cover the medical bills. 

My dad used what was left to buy a used car because he was in the same ward as the amputees and he saw all of them fresh out of the surgery before they were fully healed and he said over half of them were motorcycle accidents and that's all my dad had driven since high school. He's never been on a bike since."

Total mobilized: 42.2 million

This is a 12% death rate which is higher than more modern wars but around 10% dead was not uncommon.

The 57% rate is the total number of casualties which includes the dead, wounded, missing and captured as a percentage of the 42.2 million.  Both world wars resulted in horrible loss of life but if you were a soldier on the ground you had decent odds of making it home alive."

Americans can order car bombs in America all they like, I'm sure 90% of them have no idea what it's named for.

In you're past research and knowledge, does this seem like the ONLY plausible explanation?

todayilearned,"""The practice of [Russian media] focusing on disasters elsewhere when one occurs in the Soviet Union is so common that after watching a report on Soviet television about a catastrophe abroad, Russians often call Western friends to find out whether something has happened in the Soviet Union.""

I think what it's getting at is that Russians don't expect their own media to report on their own national disasters. This means that the Russians check with their western friends for Russian news. 

The statement might also be saying that because Russians believe that foreign disasters are the centre of media attention in Russia, the Russians believe that foreign media will also predominantly focus on disasters foreign to that foreign media's country.

The documentary sent me down the rabbit hole again, realizing the depth of the teams rise to stardom. I was particularly taken with Rodney Mullen's story as well as Stacy Peralta.

When she woke up, she couldn't speak English, but spoke very fluent German. There are also other cases about patients with Autism who have incredible mental capacity (such as a man who only thought in numbers and a child who could recite an entire orchestra from memory just by hearing it once) So my questions are:

1.) Has there been any new research conducted that could possibly determine what causes these cases?  If so, is it only possible to be this mentally gifted only if you're burdened with a disorder?

2.) In the future, could we use this information to capture/unlock some thing inside us that could ""unleash our full potential""?

Interestingly, they did a show of hands at the beginning and end to see how many people’s minds changed and only a couple out of the 500 or so in the room said the debate changed their minds.  So…..I’m not sure I’ll win over any hearts and minds here today! 

I absolutely understand the pro-labeling folks. I have 5 kids and I want to know exactly what they are eating.  However, I’m also a scientist and I know that GM foods are safe so it’s hard for me to see a use to labeling food with GMOs.

We need to be very focused, and work longer than usual.

I read this a really long time ago, but I don't remember her *not* highlighting those problems.  I agree it was a kind of socio-economic tourism, but from what I remember, she acknowledged that.  I could be remembering it wrong, though.  

As for taking a job that could have gone to someone who needed it, while I see your point, I also think that to get the kind of insight she wanted, she needed to actually do those jobs and not rely on accounts people would have given to someone they knew was writing a book.  I also think she got to meet way more people with relevant insights--people doing the kind of work she was writing about--by having those jobs.

There are comments stemming from this article that have become FGM vs male Circumcision and how it's abhorrent that FGM is banned and not male circumcision. I just wanted to point out that people are more fervent about FGM because it IS so much worse and has WAY more complications."
todayilearned,"This misses a lot of historical context, in which gay men started dying of AIDS en masse, the media called it a gay related disease, and the US federal government refused to fund research on HIV/AIDS, with a common political opinion being that having it was a moral failing, since besides gay people the other group of people to get it were heroin addicts.  The situation improved by the 1990s, but still the personal moral reservations of doctors and scientists made it difficult for gay patients to trust the treatments they were being given.  After all, no one was certain about the efficacy of AZT and other medication, but patients would still see many of their friends dying after taking it.   Of course, Continuum was dead wrong in their denial of HIV/AIDS.  But its existence shows just how poorly the scientific and medical communities responded to the disease, how politics got in the way, and with few other options patients started trying to treat themselves.

I wish I could tell you I once saw Craig James hot-wire a Trans-Am and take Chris Berman out on hooker killing spree, but that didn't happen. THAT I KNOW OF.

iama,"&gt; Think about what you've just said. Aside from the fact that producing anything gets cheaper for you when you scale it up, it's six times larger than the average farm. It's like you're saying the guy making $180,000 a year isn't much better off than the guy making $30,000 (six times less) a year. 

Yeah, I guess I didn't think it all through. Scaling up allows them to own things they'd rent or hire otherwise, diversify their crops a little to cushion them when corn prices tank, have less hail risk, and have more spare stuff around. I don't believe they'll actually save much with bulk discounts, but maybe.

Still, loss years will be had, and they can be brutal. This year a lot of fields got hail, the rain was not that great, and corn prices looked low last time I checked. Just because a farm is big doesn't mean they'll have much disposable income at any given time."

Lacquers had to be recreated to be fire retardant, sprinkler systems installed. Trees removed in order for streets to widened.

science,"The amount of science going into repro/AI these days is downright impressive. I know that all the science in modern agriculture rubs people the wrong way because it clashes with their preconceived idea that farming should be about humble, uneducated people tilling dirt and cows feeding on rolling grassy hills like they see in TV ads. In reality lots of herdsmen these days are college grads with agricultural degrees who know a hell of a lot more about cow repro than I could ever dream of as a 3rd year vet med student. These people rightly take their livelihoods seriously because farming is a competitive business and the farmers who don't embrace technology don't stay farmers for very long."
worldnews,"&gt; How is it that there are entire places in the world where men seem to think rape is totally okay.

I wouldn't say there is really anywhere in the world where rape is considered ""totally ok"". In this specific case, rape is a serious crime in Dubai and is punishable with the death sentence for extreme cases. The attackers in this case are all in police custody and will be sentenced next week. That shows very clearly that is not considered acceptable.

science,"&gt; Religion probably has something to do with that, at least the western types. Humanity being told in it's formative years that the animals were put here for humans to use, pay no mind to how the animals are treated and heaven forbids you consider they might have feelings, probably did not do us any favors in the long run.

Very true. As a religious person, I think God intended us to be wise stewards when He gave man dominion over the beast and to be prudent and grateful in the use thereof. Unfortunately, like a lot of religious ideas, doctrines have been abused to suit all sorts of ends.

We won't stop there though, they will eventually have machines that will plant, harvest, package and ship the crops with no human interaction.

Sure, we will eventually.  But airplane technology does not move as fast as cell phones.  All flying vehicles need fuel tanks/batteries at this point.   Quad copters have actual size limits because of engineering issues which are quite challenging to overcome. 

In the end, full automation is likely.  But the idea that just because we have drones means it's 'just around the corner' is ridiculous.  We'll have flying cars eventually too, but that doesn't mean the 1960s predictions came true straight away.

My guaranteed payment is $120,000 annually. This would be comparable to a salary.

I also make a bonus based off the performance of the company, 10% off net income AFTER guaranteed payments to members (we have 3 members).

Finally, I have my retained earnings, which is proportional to my equity % in the company.

So, if the company does not make money, the only compensation I receive is $120k. However, if cash flow is tight, management will defer their guaranteed payments as a liability on the balance sheet until the company is in a position to pay. This means, the management team could sometimes not choose to pay themselves (even their guaranteed payments) if they feel the company needs to use that cash to maintain operations.

science,"I just looked at the paper using my uni subscription. Apart from the caption on the figure, the abstract is actually the full text. Probably that's why they didn't feel the need to offer the PDF for free. It would've been nice, though, since the figure is pretty useful to understand the proposal.

Basically he is saying that you should cut two straight lines across the whole cake. You eat the middle, and place the two remaining portions together so that the cake doesn't dry out. You can put a rubber band around it to keep it together. However, it is apparently important that the rubber come from India.

science,"Hey Jason, thanks for the AMA!. I'd like to know what your thoughts are on the use of computing to advance understanding of neuroscience. Specifically, it is be becoming possible to simulate entire brains from the neuron up. While we cannot yet claim a simulation of the entire environment (fluids, chemical reactions), there have been interesting results from linking many simulated neurons together in a simulated environment and watching simple intelligence emerge. Do you think this computer simulation approach has anything substantial to offer in terms of understanding the biology of intelligence?

I'm less interested in the top down approach and more in the bottom up (eg creation of a new intelligence from component parts vs algorithms that solve certain problems well), but if you know of interesting work in any context that would be interesting. "
iama,"Sounds to me like you're on the right path, unless you're losing money in the stock market and hate working at your family's business.  I guess my advise would be to enjoy and appreciate being a teenager.  Looking back at my own teenage years I wish I had appreciated them more at the time.  Remember, ""be here now!"".  and write if you can.  Poetry, a diary, anything that documents your activities and thoughts and feelings.  If you can't write, dictate them into a digital recorder and save them on your computer.  You may think you'll remember everything, but you won't remember the details, and the details contain the best memories.  Good luck."

My example would be my parents Husky, who I watched intentionally run through his invisible fence, and when I called him he turned, looked at me and then kept walking.  It appeared to me he legitimately thought about answering my call, then said fuck it I'm going hiking.  I don't see this in my parent's Shepherd, only the Husky."
science,"That might be true for some farmers. Many smallholders, however, can neither afford pesticides nor are GM crops available in their area. They are farming organic by default. My farm is organic by choice - I don't want to push organic here, but basic research in agronomic measures like using inversive ploughing, harrows and grass clover mixtures to control weeds would benefit not only industrial farming but overall agronomic output and improve the food production in places where calories are less abundant."
iama,"The UNESCO figure is for ‘collections and collector pieces’ and ‘antiques of an age exceeding 100 years’. - That could cover everything from a Chippendale desk to the Chalcolithic. To imply that this is the size of the legal market for antiquities is sleight of hand.

My assessment for the average size of the antiquities auction market comes from David Gill. This takes into account rare sales like the Guennol Lioness.

The clitorial glans has a much higher concentration of nerve cell endings than any part of the penis glans. Removing it or parts of the surrounding also very highly nerve-concentrated tissue will reduce and in many cases incapacitate sexual enjoyment, whilst no such thing has been proven to be true for the penis/foreskin."

The other Presidents have just gone along with the suits in the State Deptt. As a result, you now have more frenemies than either clear-cut enemies or friends. e.g. The Pakistanis were hiding Osama Bin Laden in plain view and when caught, just denied it all.

Some time in future, the USA will have to defang her frenemies, unless they reform themselves. The first on the list will be Pakistan."

You'll see the error bars on there which means that the true value lies somwhere within those bars (with the figure given being the most likely).  The ultimate point is that we're able to see that we've had a measurable impact that has warmed the planet by an that amount. "

Those 19 public prisons are also full of pot smokers just like the private one. It's a red herring to claim that the private-ness of the prison is why drug offenders are locked up, and yet you'll notice _that's exactly what the person above claimed_. "

You don't appear to know what science is.  You think that because the Mayans extrapolated long-term from short-term data and failed, that any future extrapolation done by mankind is automatically invalid.  As if the techniques used to analyze data haven't improved since the days of the ancient Mayans.  It's an absurd proposition, as is everything else you've posted.  You are referencing Steve Ackerman's freshman-level text because it's all you are capable of understanding.

iama,"Sam: Nooo! You're right that looters/smugglers won't get market value for their material - and, as Neil Brodie, Peter and others have shown, looters/early point smugglers get tiny shares of the profit. Still, hundreds of sites, thousands upon thousands of tombs, have been looted; so, there is a huge flow of antiquities out of the country. And some very valuable pieces have been carried out within that flow. It really must be a lot of money. But there just isn't enough evidence to guesstimate it.

Paul Barford suspects that Lebanon might be a source of counterfeit Syrian coins (http://paul-barford.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/source-antiquities-smuggled-from-syria.html)."
iama,"Peter: I'll let Sam handle this one, as he probably has a better grasp of the actual estimates of anyone out there.

I will say that unlike other black market commodities, most antiquities are laundered onto the legal market. Many big ticket items in recent years have been shown to be looted (and subsequently returned). However, you are right that ISIS/Assad/FSA are not receiving the final price, but a percentage. People in their position in the network generally receive the equivalent of 10-50% of the final sale price. 

Forgeries are often tossed in to make addition money. The forgery market is thriving and people at the source end of the chain are more than happy to try to cheat those further along. By the time things get to eBay the forgery market is huge."

But the points you made make a lot of sense, especially that we adjust our actions and behaviours if we were to visit someone else's country, so the same can be expected of them.

What fascinated me was how fashionable the 5s could be. I remember one girl who was wearing a long-sleeved white turtleneck knit top that was very tight and made of a lightweight material; it covered her skin but did nothing to hide her curves. She paired that with an expensive-looking colorful scarf and oversize Italian movie star-style sunglasses. She did not look oppressed!"

For example, on average we produce children until we are at the limits of our carrying capacity, thus no amount of economic or technological development will make us rich. However, things like AI, cybernetics and robotics can lift humanity up beyond human nature. So perhaps we should not be so afraid of AI's, with things like brain implants and and mind uploads, they may well be the next step of our evolution(besides which, they are our 'children')

This is sort of like the movie trope of a poor guy living in the slums who makes it big and still sleeps on the floor, or a soldier traumatized by war [Homeland] who sleeps on the floor, under the house, etc.  Not shame at all, just the reality of the power of fear and the realization of one's inner humility and humanity.

science,"No, because a committed relationship is not a marriage. Which was the point of the original comment. A marriage is an incredibly strong legal contract. A relationship is not. In a marriage the decision is ""Do I value a fit spouse more than I value 50% of my belongings, numerous tax benefits, potentially losing my home, and losing my spouse?"" And then throw kids in there, and holy shit is it a nightmare to get away from your spouse.

In a committed relationship the decision is ""Do I value a fit spouse more than the emotional stress of losing this relationship?""

Huge difference. As the answer to the second question is often ""Yes"", people in a committed relationship have a strong motivation (as well as plenty of other equally valid motivations) to remain fit. No one is willing to sacrifice their home to potentially find a mate thats a bit more lean, thus the motivation is gone."

Working in management, I'm also much better at handling my employees mistakes and coaching them in a positive way, instead of just making them feel like shit (which they can do fine on their own, they don't need me for that... just like I can feel like shit on my own about what I've done wrong.)"

During initial training we spent a lot of time studying relevant  laws, so it never worried anyone would sue (though they all claim they will). I wouldn't say I am worried people pose a threat (usually) but I always have a very cautious feeling going through my mind.

It would still be pretty incredible if it could reduce the need for antibiotics or be used in tandem with them. I can't access full article so I can't tell you the drawbacks. If I had to guess I would think cost, sensitivity to how soon after infection the beads need to be used, or the long term ramifications of adding these beads to your bloodstream."
iama,"Yes, some do. There are probably a variety of reasons for this. Some maybe had it so bad at home that Escuela Caribe was an improvement. Some kids did have major drug problems before they got sent away, and for those kids they at the very least were forced to get clean and finish high school. And others just chose to view their time at Escuela Caribe as an overall positive. 

In my personal opinion (as I can't speak for those students who support the program) I think some were helped in spite of, not because of, the program. Sure, if you were hooked on meth before being sent away and got clean, that's a good thing. But, this was not the best intervention and often caused a lot of other problems like PTSD. 

"
worldnews," My argument is clearly valid and you've missed my point completely. 



 My point is about authoritarianism being apt for a developing economy, as opposed to developed ones.  Singapore is a de facto one party state, with authoritarian traits as demonstrated by your point about them prohibiting certain forms of pubic assembly. 

Singapore is also a developed economy - maybe it's time for fully functioning representative democracy. China is still a developing economy - authoritarianism should prevail for a little while longer, and Hong Kong will unfortunately have to up with it. 
"
worldnews,"I cannot imagine Russia would do this or advocate that the separatists do this. Russia wants control of adjacent land masses and water rights for oil. Russia does not want to start armed hostilities with the EU.

If the info I've seen here is true and the Russian separatists in Ukraine are to blame, I suspect that those directly responsible will be on the run from everyone. Russia isn't going to help them. I don't know to what extent Russia would help the Ukraine and/or the EU bring them to justice, but at the very least I don't foresee them assisting the rebels in this specific instance.

Long term, Russia will probably try to distance itself from the rebels but continue to press for ownership of the Crimea, insisting that the rebels act of their own accord."
science,"Scientists (theorists in particular) sit around and think a lot about how things might work. Then they do a bunch of experiments to see if anything interesting happens. Once in awhile they hit upon something pretty neat and then more scientists decide to do experiments with tiny variations from the initial idea, forming a more complete understanding of the phenomena. 

It's sorta like when you're playing battleship. First you throw out a bunch of guesses, but then when you've made a hit you focus on the area surrounding that initial hit until you've exposed the whole ship."
iama,"It's irrelevant.  At most this AMA fooled a few thousand ignorant children into thinking NK isn't all that bad and it's mostly just lies- all those bad things people say about the North.  99% of the readers and responders won't remember this next week.   Those who do remember will not ever have an opportunity,  need or desire to make an opinion on NK known or act in any way to support NK.

iama,"With the exception of being catcalled (I
concede, a real issue) the last third of your post was about being uncomfortable around poor people. How bad is it for you to see a homeless person in a dumpster? Come on, that's terrible.

Edit: and what is wrong with people who take the bus or eat at soup kitchens? Solidarity with the poor is a part of a Jesuit education. Certainly there are concerns about safety as in any urban campus, but the idea that the poor are to blame (as you implied by saying that those who ask for spare change, sit in dumpsters, eat at soup kitchens, bum cigarettes, and ride the bus make you uncomfortable) show that you do not intend on having a Jesuit education."
todayilearned,"Honestly, if you think that overtime gets reported in these reports you're being naive. The approach in the private sector in Denmark is in general that you work until the job is done. If this means that you work insanely long work weeks some week so be it. However, you never report that. It only brings trouble to the company and since the Danish wage system is the way it is, the employers have to fork over a lot of money for wages. Companies just couldn't remain competetive if ""overtime"" was something they had to pay for as well.

(Don't get me wrong. I have friends that have 30 hour work weeks as well, and live off that just fine. The point I'm trying to make is that you really don't get a lot of transparency into the private sector through these reports)"

worldnews,"Weather radar only. The missile is way out of what those are designed to pick up, and even if the weather radar were on (no need to use that if the weather's clear), it'd probably sweep the route ahead, not towards the ground.

Technically, radar warning systems could sense the incoming energy (radar lock on), but I would be surprised if those were installed to civilian jets.

Finally, there's Eyeball Mk I which has been used before (I think a commercial airliner was used to help spot a sailing yacht in trouble near Australia), but I doubt that the crew would be on continuous missile watch. (And the windows on the passenger jets aren't quite designed for that.) In theory, they could spot the exhaust from a missile, but by then it'd be way too late for a jet that size to do much."
worldnews,"Can we be real right now, as much as it pains me to say it, making something like this public knowledge makes no difference, it's not going to cause any kind of public outrage and at the most their will be some small protests that will be silenced as quickly as possible.

iama,"I have worked with many different Asian suppliers in industry and it is very frustrating until you realize they don't like to say no.  In fact, many times they say yes, but the yes means ""yes, I understand your question.""  We have sourcing documents that are massive and require responses from all suppliers before sourcing.  It's essentially a ton of bullet points requiring a response in the affirmative or objections with details on what they are willing to take responsibility for.  We expect only about half of the stuff to be agreed to, and most suppliers have detailed responses to what they will and will not do.  When we get Asian company replies every single thing is  replied to as ""yes,"" but they don't really agree with it.  It's tough to determine roles, and even when we do they often ignore things.

Yet they are often cheap as hell so of course we are pressured to use them even though it can be a crapshoot."
todayilearned,"Things have changed since WW I. It is fairly safe to deploy chemical weapons now (for the attacker). Military chemical units have support from meteorologist now. We understand the persistence of various agents now. Also, we can just launch them from aircraft or missiles. As for handling them.....it is even safer now. Binary agents were developed. 2 safe chemicals that mix in flight to create the lethal agent. See GB2. 

The CWC and other treatises were signed because, quite frankly, EVERYONE is scared of Chem agents. The hardest infantryman will be scared, you can't shoot back at it."
iama,"Like I've said before; it differs per person (including being able to remember). One way to test if you are at a certain depth is things like eye-fixation, arm levitation and the like.

From what you've told me thus far I'd say that you're close to the edge of going 'out' but not quite there.

Now there's also another factor. You have a goal (orgasming from hypnosis) and have a difficulty achieving that goal. Do the tracks you listen to build up? Do they make you touch yourself? Having an orgasm purely through hypnosis is not something most people can do without at least a bit of conditioning.

Most of the time before you go for ""cum by command"" you first build up, condition and go for orgasm control."
worldnews,"People keep talking about how many ""Muricans"" were on the plane, well ""Muricans"" stop worrying so much about your own nationality there are other nationalities out there too and there lives are also important respect everyone who died not people from just your own country.

With this I am sorry for the people who died today and send the families my condolences

Edit: People have been commenting saying that it isn't about just who died but more about what actions USA will take after this and my response is who cares? A tragedy happened not even 2 or 3 hours ago and we are already looking for someone to kill, mourn the dead first and then worry about vengeance. "
iama,Hi! I'm on day 17 now and I'm pretty much following it to a t but swapping some meals say if I'm out and can't make a hot lunch I do a salad recipe. But my question is- I've had a Choco smoothie and grapefruit for bfast everyday like u say but I notice that there is a recipe for oatmeal. Can I eat steal cut oats instead? I know it would be fine but as good as the smoothie and grapefruit? I'm trying to be really successful here. Also I don't always eat dessert. Is that awful? I usually drink hot tea at night instead.

When SC2 came out, I was a bit disappointed in the editor, which seemed to me to be a bit TOO clunky and advanced with an intense learning curve compared to the fairly simple Warcraft 3 editor and the incredibly easy (but also not very advanced) Starcraft editor.

Also add to fact that maps aren't easily shared, but I have a feelings that's not your decision (End complaint. Commence question)

Do you have any plans to ease out the learning curve and provide a bit more feedback to make learning through trial and error in the editor possible? I would love getting into SC2 mapmaking, but as it is now, it's just... too much for my poor easily confused mind! (And I'm a Java/PHP programmer!!)

worldnews,"&gt;The research about circumcised penises and sexual pleasure and sensitivity are not under debate

iama,"All that is true, but I think the bigger issue here is Russia and Iran. Both are absolutely hellbent on propping up Assad, and Putin particularly is looking for an opportunity to flex some muscle on the international scene. If the US / EU were to actively try to depose Assad, Russia might well decide to stand up behind him with equal force. Proxy wars with Russia and Iran, which also stand to undermine the fragile healing process currently underway between Iran and the US? No thank you. That would help no one, including, in all likelihood, the poor people of Syria, who would find a much-escalated conflict between outsiders who are just trying to make a political point."
iama,"ISIS is not really a branch of al-Qaeda. They're the evolution of AQI (al-Qaeda in Iraq) which always had problems with Al-Qaeda leadership based in the af-pak region. Al-Zawhiri publicly denounced ISIS for not conforming to their ideologies and undermining operations. 
I see the principal difference to be about objectives. Al-Qaeda evolved from domestic taqfiri organizations (like Islamic Jihad) that opposed national Arab leaders into an organization of global jihad. Global jihad involved attacking Western targets to provoke a reaction that would create conditions favorable to the rise of radical Islamism. ISIS seems more like one of the domestic organizations, in that it is focused on regime change, but the difference is that stretches across multiple countries. Also their designs are apparent in their name: they want an Islamic state throughout the Levant (al-Sham). "
todayilearned,"While I agree with your premise, I feel that it takes much, *much* more to understand the intricacies of counting calories. Should you include the cheese? How many is those pickles?

todayilearned,"My coworkers (one, a member of the LDS, and the other an ex-LDS member) were having a discussion about how individual churches keep detailed records of the whereabouts of current and former members. When members leave a specific church, or leave the Mormon church all together, they attempt to track where the person is, and then alert the nearest LDS church. After they are located, the nearest members of that congregation will go the the ex-members door to attempt to make friends and establish communication with the ex-member to better understand their current situation.

I am not posting this to talk about the morals of this practice, just thought it was intriguing. 

[EDIT] If any members of the LDS wish to weigh in on this, I would love to know more about the validity of their conversation. The coworker who is a member of the church is in charge of maintaining the file system and updates all files on current and ex-members. "
worldnews,"&gt; I didnt say they call everyone a terrorist, so you're lying here. I said they frequently name people they disagree with as terrorists.

""frequently name people they disagree with as terrorists"" - which implies the notion that most of their designations are invalid, and as I have demonstrated is pretty much false.

&gt; You're ad hominem is idiotic.

First it may help to look up the definition of ad Hominem, rather than sprinkle it around like a child who just learned it. I did not call you a fool, only that if you wished to stop appearing like one, you should retract the statement. Obviously you now look foolish for continuing your pointless dick measuring competition with me. Your loss I guess."
iama,"Although you are correct, the Supreme Court already ruled against medicinal marijuana in California using the same commerce clause. They basically said the legalisation of medicinal marijuana would mess up the interstate commerce of recreational marijuana. Yes, that sounds completely fucking retarded as marijuana is an illegal substance that wouldn't be ""sold"" anyway... But that was the opinion of the court. It's also important to note that the ""conservative"" justices who made that hypocritical vote should logically (and historically) be FOR legalisation as they all scream about states rights all the damn time...well except when it comes to morally (religious) questionable stuff, can't have that!

todayilearned,"You definitely have to be in a certain mood to watch it. For me, it's the perfect relaxation movie - I watch it when I want to calm down after a long day or when I just want some good background noise. It's one of my favorite movies ever, but nine times out of ten I'll pass it over in favor of something a little louder or faster.

In the same vein, I wish someone had told me that Blade Runner was nothing like the name implies, because I watched it expecting something Star Wars-esque and ended up being very disappointed. I feel like it could easily be one of my favorites if I just watched it at the right time, but I have yet to want to try again."
worldnews,"As an American, I started digging around for more about what's going on since the news here spews out all the same anti Russian shit. There are many, many factors coming into play as to why Russia is doing what it's doing and it's making more sense as to why this is happening. I think it was a bad start to invade Crimea that quickly, since I feel that Russia and the new Ukrainian government could have had similar relations as to the previous Russian supported government. But there could be explanations for why they chose to invade. Maybe there was more at stake.  The loss of it's ports on the black sea would greatly hinder it's military capability and judging from Russia's past (and you), that would not make the Russia as a whole very happy."
iama,"Sorry kitten, I think what ted is talking about is more than merely having an Associate of Arts from your local community college. But rather having attended a top-50 university with at least a 3.5+ GPA and having the ambition and drive to pursue goals that will not only enrich your life but will also make the world a better place.

I believe that if you made enough money in (or had a passion for) research, engineering, or art, you wouldn't need to disrobe on the internet. As far as I recall, Marie Curie didn't need to supplement her income by whoring herself around at the local cathouse in between discovering new elements."
worldnews,"It's funny how Americans are reacting to the various news coming out, for example, they get a chuckle out of articles like this. ""Take that Putin"" ""Suck it Russia"", ""The Bear doesn't need cars.""

But this means loss of jobs and markets in the West, especially Germany probably France and England.  Not to mention that France will soon have to pay back Russia practically triple that Russia paid for undelivered ships.

This also means that Russians will buy more domestic-made goods and that products from Russia now become bargains.  Russia is big in heavy industry and weapons industries and this will help with sales to foreign countries.

So I don't understand why Americans are so overjoyed by the results of sanctions and Saudi Arabia's  over production.

In my opinion, Saudi Arabia seems to be playing a very short term strategy against Iran and foreign oil producers that does not seem very smart both in economic terms and political terms."
askreddit,Anyone can Google how to properly collect semen from a dog. this person is raping animals. He or she is attacking them and forcing them to ejaculate. Just because a dog can't consent doesn't mean its okay. When done properly the male is aroused by a female in heat and its positioned to hump a fake vagina that collects the semen which is then stored and probably frozen. Its natural and safe for the dog. We work on his terms. As opposed to using our larger size to force it or use the animals trust against him. I consider randomly jacking off dogs to be rape. The animal might not cry or be physically injured but its still hurting the animal. So if what mister donkey says is true then he has a psychological compulsion to abuse animals the same way a pedophile has a compulsion to abuse kids. The fact that he's in denial of this is so telling.
worldnews,"I'm conflicted by this. As a circumcised male, I'm not totally against circumcision. But people bring up some really good points about just how unnecessary the procedure is. I'm not sure what I will do when/if I have a son.

Comparing male circumcision to cutting off a cliterous is just comparing apples to oranges though. The equivalent of a male circumcision to a female would be cutting back the cliteral hood. The equivalent of FGM for males would be cutting off the tip of the penis completely.

[edit: Okay, fuck all you assholes. I will make my decision after speaking with my wife and doctors, then make an informed decision. I won't just do it because it is ""tradition"". I'm certainly not going to take medical advice from a bunch of neck bearded asshats. You can all suck my beautifully  circumcised dick.]"
iama,"Great question! We actually don't want to compete with them. Reason? Because we would lose all of our existing business with specialty toy stores all around the US. If RingStix makes it into Walmart that's the end of the toy. If it sells well t may stay in the stores 2-5 years but then no one will ever want it again.

So to answer your question we really are targeting those parents that want something out of the ordinary that you can't find at Walmart, and the way we do that is we keep winning awards such as the ASTRA Toy of The Year Award. (which RingStix won)"
iama,"No idea if you are still doing this AMA, I think I missed it, but why were you caught up in this ring doing these things? Was it one of the mafia'ish type groups or organized crime?

From what I have read and seen over the years, a lot of groups in your region tend to be very brutal in persuading people to do what they need...any violence or threats or anything?

iama,"Eating is somewhat complicated. A multitude of different issues converge to make the consumption of food and drink to be more of a chore than something that is enjoyed. I need to take lots of supplements, get vitamin shots, and possibly will need IV infusions at some point. I have to eat 6 or more times a day, but small portions. I can't have too many carbs or it'll set off my hypoglycemia. I also need to keep my diet high in protein, calories, and fat in order to keep my weight from plummeting. Eating a lot of protein makes my pancreas angry a lot of the time. Anything and everything can (and usually does) make me feel nauseated. Also, having no stomach means I never feel hunger, ever.  "
science,Cows are actually the ones who have it the best. But what you saw was not representative of the large majority of farming. The little cute farms that people like make up less than half of the farms in the US. Last time I did the research it was about 40%. If you look at the statistics for pigs and chickens I believe it was like 60% of pigs are factory farmed and somewhere around 80%+ of chickens are. So the VAST majority of these animals are treated terribly. Dont kid yourself. Look at the data from the department of agriculture. 
iama,"When the stomach is removed from the digestive tract, the body goes into a sort of crisis mode where it re-evaluates how to continue operating properly without the stomach anymore. So when food passes from my esophagus to my little pouch and into the small intestine, that's where what I eat and drink gets broken down and absorbed into my blood stream. Certain things like raw veggies (salads) end up being useless to eat because my body doesn't break that down or absorb much from it. Sometimes I crave them, so I will eat some salad anyway. But mostly, I just avoid whatever my body tends not to agree with. Each person who's had a total gastrectomy works differently too. My father can drink soda (that's all he drinks) and eat as much sweets and carbs as he wants without fail. I, however, cannot. "

Look at the amount of countries, including the United States, who have aided terrorists at one point, it's a part of geopolitics, once again, to think the responsibility would fall on Russia short of  evidence of their direct involvement is just plain wrong.

Ukrainians tore down the statue to further reclaim their national identity - to send a statement to Russia that the days of dictatorship should be left in the past. That Putin's antiques aren't welcomed.                                      
Russia will read that statement differently, as ""we're no longer brothers. I don't respect you or your grandparents.""

And I should note that many conservative Ukrainians would agree with that stance.

iama,"It's kind of like a ""Six Degrees of Separation"" thing.  You, by definition, have a Biegel Number of zero, and you're the only person who does.  If someone who does not have a Biegel Number of N or less, but they have acted in a movie with a person who has a Biegel Number of N, then they have a Biegel Number of N+1.

For example, you've got a Biegel Number of 0, and John Lithgow's got a Biegel Number of 1 because you and he were both in *Footloose*.  Somebody who has been in a movie with John Lithgow but not with you would have a Biegel Number of 2.  And so on.

It turns out you were a good choice of the ""center"" of this - it's pretty difficult to find actors with Biegel Numbers above maybe three or four or so."
todayilearned,"Except 5% of the total prison system does not equate to 5% of the political capital of the prison system. These prisons actively lobby for mandatory minimum sentencing and other ineffective policies shown only to increase the prison population, such as the mandatory minimum sentence for crack cocaine possession, which was only overturned in 2010. Those 5% of prisons play a significant role in the formation of sentencing laws because they, unlike the other 95% of prisons, have an economic incentive to lock more people up. So actually it is directly relevant to the discussion at hand."
iama,"Grad students vs. Undergrads:
There were a couple of graduate students who had been given an area to study in, but had trouble getting a good sense of the research in that area, or really how to find it.  They seemed to generally not have a very firm grasp on how to navigate the internet, when I'd work with them to find related work on the things they were trying to work on (e.g. optimization of costs in cloud computing)

When I was talking with some of the students about maybe going to wonson (for skiing, which unfortunately didn't open before i left this winter) they wanted to talk about the highway.  It got built in the 90s by student groups, and they were really proud of it as an example of perseverance for the country, because, as they explained, the country had a lot of trouble in the 90s, and there were a lot of food problems.  so, nationalist tinge maybe, but not a false understanding of the world."
iama,"Haha, i figured since you used the term aquaria.  I am not the type but I know that there were at least 40 names in line to get the tanks.  There were three tanks in particular that were pretty expensive i guess.  There is a legal process for 'acquired' equipment going to auction but there were definitely employees and volunteers from our agency at the auction that day.  The fish were adopted out a very cheap price.  We don't have much space at our facility to house a large number of fish.  We only have 15 tanks, and usually lizards take up half of them, so we are creative in processing large groups of animals we deal rarely with."

Colonialism is something entirely different from what has happened in Israel. Granted, a large number of Jews immigrated to Israel in the 20th century and became the dominant population.

So let me ask you, is one Jew moving to Israel an act of colonialism? How about two? How many Jews have to move to Israel for it to be considered colonialism? "

iama,"Not a thing. I wouldn't tell him or attempt to spare him a single moment of this life. Good or bad it's been mine. Ive become the person I am because of my struggles. To deprive myself of even one of those moments of hardship changes the fundamental bedrock of who I am. 

The best lesson I've learned as an adult is this:

I'm a man who can't be beaten. Not because there is anything exceptional about me but because I know for an absolute fact that victory and defeat are a matter of choice. Something being hard, that's out of your hands. Something being impossible.... That's because you didn't try hard enough, you cut a corner, you didn't want it bad enough, you weren't willing to take it to the ground as much as someone else was.

There might be 1000 difficult steps involved in getting what you want. But that's not the same thing as impossible. And if I don't get there. That's my fault. End of story."
worldnews,"The insight is just interesting, numbers really become arbitrary in tragedy. ~110,000 dead in the Mexican drug war through the past 8 years, ~250,000 in the past 3 years in Syria, or any other statistic we pull up, our estimates have an error on the order of thousands of innocent lives. ~300 lost lives - or even the 3000 on 9/11 - pales in comparison to the endless human extermination occurring daily elsewhere, in news some choose to ignore.

Back to my wonder, is it easier to comprehend atrocities with larger or fewer deaths? 9/11, school shootings and other massacres, Benghazi, and certainly this news are examples of tragedies with which people and media develop complex emotional associations. To be frank, it seems easier to come to terms with larger atrocities and not bat an eye at the growing arbitrary number. Or is this entirely an opinion rather than an observation?"
iama,"I don't get it, the father of the child didn't store his gun properly and that's why your child was shot. Kids in other western countries get bullied, and that's terrible, but they don't have the ability to bring a firearm into school because A) their parents don't have access to firearms and B) if they do have guns, the parents have mandated training and storage procedures.

You said it yourself, the gun owner got away scot free despite the fact that a 9 year old kid could access his loaded weapon. That's not right."
iama,"you are standing in a hallway with 100 doors. Evens on one side, odds on the other. You begin with all of the doors closed. You then open every first door (all doors now open). You come back and open or close every 2nd door (2,4, 6 etc.) you then come back and open or close every third door (3,6,9 etc). How many doors are open after you go all the way to opening or closing every 100th door? You always do the opposite action of what the door is when you reach it. If it is open you close it, if it is closed you open it. "
iama,":: sigh ::

I'm sure you don't mean to be but just a heads up, that can come off as quite offensive to others. Bodies come in all different shapes, sizes, and configurations. 

I only say that it can come across offensively because the amount of times people of my stature have heard ""Get a cheese burger,"" or ""eat more, you fucking stick,"" are endless. And it's pretty much the exact same as asking someone slightly overweight what their problem is and they should eat less. 

Some of us have a hard time gaining true weight / muscle mass. I have a swimmers body (grew up swimming and continued it until about 22). Sometimes we can be slim in one way but not in others.

todayilearned,"No, it isn't being sexist, you're just trying to spin it that way. I noticed you cut out part of the quote,

I'm not saying all girls are more intelligent than guys. I'm saying that the particular girls in my class that were being offered the help didn't need it. And in those cases, the girls were harder workers specifically than the guys offering to help. They weren't harder workers because they were girls, they just worked hard and therefore had better grades and didn't need help. That's not sexist."
iama,"We threw away enough product (especially plain Tim Bits) as it was, giving away a few Tim Bits to dogs really wasn't a big deal. The only people I would make pay were the assholes who would show up and then go, ""Where's the Tim Bit for my dog?"" like they were entitled to one. In a few cases, I hadn't even noticed the dog and the customer just came off as an asshole. They could've casually mentioned the dog somehow, but no, had to be an entitled jerk.

todayilearned,"Best Buy employee here. When you look at Samsung and Apple's tablets side by side there's really no competition. Samsung's LED display is far more vibrant and colorful then the retina display on an IPad. Samsung as a company is not hurting itself in any way by manufacturing Apple's display for them. Because Apple has become such a commonly known name brand, (much like Band-aid or Kleenex) Samsung makes a huge profit from them while also providing better all around specks for there phones and tablets. And as people realize this, we're seeing more and more customer's trade in their iPhones and iPads for Samsung Galaxy product. As it stands people still come in all the time, look at a Samsung tablet and ask ""How much does this iPad cost?"" But if Apple doesn't step it up big time with their next iPad and iPhone launches we'll definitely be seeing them slowly fall out of the competition as company's like LG are starting to move up."
science,"The strong consensus among scientists is that existing GMOs are safe.  I have no idea of 'holistic nutritionists' might think, but I don't think I'm inclined to care.

Seedless watermellons are a product of conventional breeding; there is no transgene involved, so they are not considered GMO.  They are 'modified' in the sense that they have undergone selective breeding and are, in this case, infertile (aka seedless).  This is usually accomplished by finding polyploid lines and making triploid progeny.

The primary GMOs are Corn and Soybean, though there are lesser-known GMOs like Papaya which, without the viral transgene, would have been wiped out by the papaya ringspot virus."

2) Do you konw players that likely have good advisors, but simply choose to ignore it and live beyond their means?

It seems as though athletes should base their lifestyle on how much they have earned so far, rather than what they think they will earn in the future.  It's not difficult to calculate how much someone should spend in order to have a sustainable lifestyle well beyond their careers end."
science,"Yeah, sorry, but I already have studied this and done my own experiments (fun fact, I got taught by Dr Kouwenhoven, inventor of the quantum dot, at TUDelft).

Now, what the article concerns is very interesting, the partitioning and movement of those partitioned parts of the Schrodinger equation. But Motherboard aint a scientific journal, and that quote at the end has been taken out of context. We DO know what constitutes an observation/ interaction: it is ANY interaction with the system; consciousness not required. I know this because the math tells us this, because my professors told me this. That quote at the end of the article is used as a nice interesting closing paragraph, and Maris might even have said it, but I assure you it is taken out of context, because it a) has no bearing on the experiment and b) it is not true to what we know about quantum mechanics.

iama,"I grew up playing your games on Playstation 1. They helped me bond with my fellow classmates and appreciate really cool music (like Blink 182, Motorhead and Goldfinger).

One day I wanted to try skating and my small 12 year old body fell on my armpit, I couldn't move for a few days. I can only imagine how you gather the courage to do risky maneouvers.

However, after the games I feel it became harder for me to appreciate real professional skateboarding, because the tricks are never as mindblowing as in the games, and that's how I expected them to be. How can I appreciate real skating after that? Or, what skaters should I be watching for some really mind blowing stunts?"
todayilearned,"It's information like this that makes me reflect back on the inane generalizations that we were taught as kids - ""we're all the same on the inside"", ""everyone is equal"", etc that we all came to realize was complete bullshit as we grew up. In fact, I suggest that such attempts to create the appearance that all people were just carbon copies of each other that just looked a little different actually has promoted racism by failing to address very obvious differences genetically and culturally, and leaving those questions to be dealt with in the minds of children whose morality has been guided by TV and video games for the last 30 years. Not exactly a good way to promote fair and honest understanding of humanities variability, IMO."
iama,"Ok, so I'm do various kinds of work for landlords and property management companies and one of my clients for the past 3 years has a Subway shop as one of their tenants. I end up in that shop at least once a month, sometimes several times weekly depending on whats going on at that particular plaza. Everyone else at that property knows who I am, except that subway has new staff seemingly every week... to the point where I am hard pressed to remember seeing any one employee there more than twice.

Also, I've never met the manager, they are always out.

What the every loving fuck is going on there?"
iama,"Yup, that's a good question and a frequent concern. The short answer is that we do have basic statistic training, so we can at least interpret what, say, a p-value tells us about a given result.

BUT there are definitely times the stats go over my head. In situations like that, the easiest way to check on the validity of a study is to send it to a researcher you trust and ask for their take (or, in my case, to guilt a smarter grad-school friend into asking a statistics question for you). We do our best not to endorse studies we're not sure about, of course. This is a big problem in social-science journalism. I was happy that [Melissa's writeup of that faulty hurricane-name-gender study](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/06/are-people-less-afraid-of-female-hurricanes.html) that everyone reported on included several tablespoons of skepticism.

science,"Depends on the scale and scope of the model.  The organization I work for currently runs air quality models (they're experimental mostly - I don't think anyone actually uses their forecasts in an applied sense but I'm not sure because I don't work with them) but they're mainly meant to forecast low air quality due to dust.  

Furthermore, the amount of aerosols introduced here by Chinese pollution are like nothing else in the world.  We're not talking about the smoke stack from a typical US coal plant causing changes down the road.  This is a pretty unique situation, (from what I understand) and these changes are very much regionally confined to the northern Pacific (according to the paper)."
iama,"It's cool to hear that a girl can be ""into"" making games at such a young age. I remember when I was growing up, making games was a thing we thought of as a thing big companies did; And while we loved playing them I don't think we could really conceptualise the idea that we might make them ourselves one day.

So I ended up growing up wanting to be an artist, and today I am! But I do wonder if I might've been more of a indie game designer if I ever knew it was a possibility, because as an artist I write stories and illustrate them, and I always want to take it further than just pretty pictures.

science,"Vet med student here. The cattle industry (especially the dairy industry) LOVE their computers. Pretty much every aspect of a cow's life from birth to slaughter these days is getting loaded into software for detailed analysis of ways to increase production on a given farm. Things that you wouldn't even think of, like ""oh, abortion rates went up 1.4% in the herd last month...I guess we need to call a meeting with our herdsmen and our vet to figure out what's going on. Might have to adjust the calcium and anionic salts in the ration, or think about screening for viral disease that might be bringing the rate up."" Food animal production is a very advanced science these days with tons of data being collected, so I'm really not surprised that a study of this magnitude was possible."

During your Boom Boom Huck Jam tour I was in the 5th grade, and my favorite radio station was giving away tickets to your show. I called in countless times, and actually got through 3 times, with my last call landing me the tickets.

iama,"Hey mate! I do enjoy what I do! It's one of the best jobs I've had so far. I would recommend it as a career path yes. Where I am from there are 2 types of BG's, Civil and government. Civil is guarding wealthy people, celebrities &amp; business people etc. Government is guarding politicians and state and federal officials etc. It depends what you want to do, you get to experience the high life doing civil bodyguarding (VIP's enjoy the party life). Government body-guarding from what i hear (I've never done it, as it always falls under law enforcement duties.) is a lot more ""boring"". So take your pick, In all honesty i would say government BG's are more highly trained. There are not many domestic threats present, its usually just overly excited fan's or ""haters"" that are the biggest ""threat"". But some jobs take weeks to plan. I hope this helped."

Can you try to help me explain the few holes I see with evolution being a sound theory because as I see it the earth has been around around 4.5 billion years with life only being a small fraction of that (im going to guess 500 million), so if life has only been around 500 million years with mass extinctions, wouldn't the evolutions needed to go from single celled organisms to highly complex multicellular organisms be to much to occur throughout the time of single celled to humans? And if this is the case that it would occur like this, how come we are still not rapidly evolving? I would guess that humans are not the pinnacle of evolution.

My daughter sat next to the shooter, because she was the smart/ quite kid in class and he was a little bit of a problem child, so the teacher wanted him next to her so he wouldn't disrupt the class. 

Details are a little sketchy because it was all derived from police statements made by the kids following the shooting, but what likely happened was he was going to pull out the gun to show it to a friend.. .coincidentally that student transferred schools within the week.  Another theory is that he was going to shoot the teacher, because he disagreed with the way he was being treated. 

Of course we will never know the real story since the boy lied in his depositions and changed his story several times to the police, bullying was never discussed under he had a lawyer. "

Basically generic alcohol dispensing rooms with as much charm as a filling station. 

It may have been fun for occasional visitors but not so much for some of us natives looking for good beer and somewhere to socialise. Hence a lot of house parties with nice Belgian beers adding to the huge downturn in public sales. Thankfully, some publicans are making the effort to attract customers, and Thomas house appears to be a good addition."

science,"This is correct, and it's because of two reasons.  The direct and indirect effects of aerosols in the atmosphere.  Aerosols, or smog, directly reflect sunlight back into space.  Additionally, they also make whiter clouds, which increase the albedo of Earth and cause more sunlight to reflect out into space.  It's a negative feedback loop too.  The greater the albedo of Earth, the less sunlight it receives and the fast it cools, which increase snowcover which increases the albedo, etc.  

This is why PM2.5 is really bad when it comes to climate change in addition to being immediately dangerous to human health."

science,"Sure, when resources are scarce, as they are destined to become as populations grow to the point where nomadic societies aren't practical, monogamy offers advantages.  But human beings evolved as nomadic creatures, not as post-agricultural creatures.  How long it takes evolutionary pressure to change a species is quite variable (it's been seen in as few as a single generation in some birds, but I've never heard of such rapid changes in humans) so there's no clue how long it'll take us to adapt to our new situation, but we've clearly still got a lot leftover from our nomadic heritage, even back to before we developed speech or reason when our social bonds (which were driven by sex) were the reason we survived even while being weak, slow, etc."

Not necessarily. They may go in for their yearly physical (you guys still have those, right?) because they're obligated to, or they may take a free blood test at their school clinic, or their parents or SO may physically take them to a doctor.

The consequences of a false-positive diagnosis for depression are not as dire as failure to diagnose an actual case. False-positives can lead to the patient being medicated for a condition they don't have, which is usually dangerous in its own right, and in extreme cases they may risk Serotonin Toxicity Syndrome with symptoms including seizures. Meanwhile they won't be getting treatment for whatever really *is* wrong with them, and it may increase stigma towards the mentally ill for people around the patient who are confused about their incongruous symptoms. It also means the medical professionals are unable to devote their time and resources to people who are depressed."

Very few people have guns for recreation (Most of these people being those above farmers or people on the outskirts) and i know of no-one who thinks having a gun for ""Personal Defence"" is in any way necessary or even desirable.

That's great that you don't eat too much salt. It causes hypertension and then high blood pressure. I prefer less salty salts, like Celtic salt, Himalayan salt, or sea salt. They're a lighter salt than table salt. I saw a chef on a cooking show talk about the influences of different types of salt on food. Not sure it's true, but he seemed convinced."

worldnews,"The sample sizes were all around 3000 for each country, but the locations were not very wide spread across the regions. Certain cities have different takes on the standard of clothing, that is for sure. I'm very surprised not to see more 5's. It is after all 2014 and women and mixing tradition with fashion. #5 is the best way to do this. I lived in Abu Dhabi for a couple of years and the women were either 2, 5, or 6. Abu Dhabi is made up of mostly expats, so the vast majority of women are from surrounding Muslim countries. #3 seemed to only be popular from East Asians in the city. I think the photos in the survey may have been an issue, due to the lack of people choosing 5. The 5 photo represents women wearing loose, yet covering hijabs. In my opinion, this fashionable wear is much more attractive for the younger girls to wear nowadays. It is becoming much more popular and may be the most chosen if this survey is done again in a few more years."
worldnews,"Wearing clothing that makes it impossible for any Westerners to interact with you is indeed shunning the west. 

Wearing clothing that makes it impossible for you to experience life from a western pov is indeed shunning the west. 

Wearing clothing that is viewed by many in the West as oppressive, and militant, is indeed shunning the west. 

Wearing clothing that makes it impossible for you to ever seem like a westerner, is indeed shunning the west.

So to answer your question, yes. 

Also, the burqa is only ""traditional clothing"" for a teeny tiny little minority of those who actually wear it. For the majority, it's because they are forced to, or because they want to show westerners how ""Islamic"" they are. 

It would be like if all of the sudden the Toga came back into style because people in Ireland wanted to show how  Catholic they were...because the Romans once wore Togas. "
iama,"It's not a very effective way to test who is actively impaired, but it was supported by no less than NORML themselves supposedly. I would guess that a cop wouldn't even test you unless he saw red, glassy eyes or smelled burned marijuana. If he has the probable cause to assume you could be stoned, the law pretty much guarantees you will get a DUI. If you are stoned enough to look and act stoned, you're probably going to jail. Which is maybe a good thing? Assuming officers use proper discretion and don't try to use possession as probable cause."
iama,"Hi Tony, thanks for doing this AMA. Skateboarding is of often associated with rebel teens and by association, sometimes linked with marijuana use. were/are you a marijuana user? I know its a loaded question but we aren't here to judge. I smoke daily, go to college, work in an office, and have been skateboarding for some time and I could be easily mis-understood. and also, What are you doing, if anything, to remove this stigma associated with skateboarding? Were you ever subject to being wrongly portrayed because of your career? A prominent figure/philanthropist such as yourself could do some great help with changing peoples' views on our youth and the negativity associated with skateboarding/marijuana use/young teens.

thanks again!"

iama,"1) that's pretty much exactly what happens with us. We do get some training on our weekly meeting but even that is really informal. 

2) it's basically up to the LJ's discretion here. I've always just asked nicely when I need them to move back. However if you are running down the sideline if they are in your way and you run into them you can call a penalty on the sideline. I've dodged a kid who I multiple times told him and everyone else to step back and after the play I told him sternly that next time anyone else on the sidelines was in my way it would cost their team. I was so frustrated by that point because I had continuously &gt; had to tell him to move for 3 quarters before this. I'm a very lenient guy. 


3) I've honestly never heard of it. I don't know if anyone in my chapter even knows about it or perhaps the Dallas chapter would know more than myself. 


4) absolutely!  Send them my way! I'll be happy to answer questions!

iama,"Hello all, thanks for taking the tie out to do this AMA.

I have a non-techie kind of question.

I own a nexus 5 with  side loaded lollipop

previously, i had the Gmail app and a separate Email app that was on the phone.

Now they are bundled up together.

I used the Email app for my work mail and gmail for personal, even tho they all ended up in my gmail.

Since they are now bundled together, they have an identical user interface, with no setting to individualize them.  (making one be a different color, for instance).

I am going to assume that Inbox will also be rolled into Gmail to keep everything tidy.

my question is, if this is the case, will there be a way to customize its appearance to make it easier to distinguish from the other two Gmail apps?"
askreddit,"Boston? It's one of the best cities in the country. 

It's hard to even find a bad area in the main part of the city anymore, it's pretty much packed full of brilliant people between the startups, the best hospitals in the country, and that it's basically the educational capital of the US.

There was a time when Boston was a pretty terrible place in the 70s-80s, as was the case with a lot of American cities. Today? I can't think of a US city of similar size that's nicer.

I'd call the biggest problem in the city today that rent/property prices are going straight up with no sign of slowing down."
science,"The yale piece directly links to the paper, while yours linked to an article that then linked to the paper, instead of directly referencing it.  

It seems a bit pedantic, but it filters for articles that are talking specifically about the paper in question, instead of more issue oriented blogs and the like.  It's not a perfect rule, but it's one that we have, and we try our best to be fair and consistent.

If you had submitted this: http://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/17231_ENG_HTML.php  it would ahve been fine, or if your submission had this:

iama,"Hey Mark! :D As said before - you are Mr.Sex. Now that we've stroked your ego, another question or two ^_^

In regards to Australian media / television and writing, what do you believe we're lacking? If you compare us to the BBC, or even American television - we are horrendously poor. Do you think it's because we've got lacking standards of writing? Or that we're just very different to the rest of the world?

I've grown up with anything BBC - I can't get enough of it. But anything shown here is dribble. That said - Please still come to Australia. We're not all dribble and pishposh."

Still forcing Jesus down kids' throats to this day. HUGE and not a rehab.  
I'll sum up their PR [sound of a farting cow[  
They have never offered any recognizable treatment to anyone.

todayilearned,"The transgression as you see it has been perverted by sexism that the very article bespeaks.

The solidifying of the fruit as an apple has to do with it occurring during the time that the bible was written in Latin (remember first it was written in; Hebrew, then Aramaic, then Greek, only then Latin, and finally English) &amp; a negative view of women (evil)

The idea of original sin is not a Jewish concept, but was added later by Christianity.  The Jewish view of it is that both Adam &amp; Eve were responsible (though some orthodox views insert a different transgression of adding to the law that Eve did, but this does not span to all women) and that it is not original sin, but a struggle against the evil inclination that we all now have to deal with, which was introduced with eating the fruit of Knowledge.

worldnews,"On the Ukranian side we might expect career military SAM site commanders, but on the separatist side the only career military would be Russian. Any captured Ukranian weapons or rumoured Russian weapons that were ""found lying on the roadside"" would be operated by reservists trained in the Red Army or Ukranian Army. Sure, the Soviet-legacy conscription period is two years, but there's only that much that sticks. Especially if the protocol asks them to check IFF/transponder tags from a command post of some kind, something which the separatists might not have.

I'd expect that Ukranian SAM sites would have career military only (since they only recently brought back the draft), unless they had called suitable reservists back. But still probably career military SAM site commanders."
iama,"The article in which I read the most detailed description of the process was talking about the place that Force Unleashed took in the hierarchy. It stuck with me because that game's story was abysmal and retconned a lot of stories out of canon. I'll try and find it. A Lucas Arts employee whose job involved managing continuity was repeatedly quoted. 

Edit: The description is less clear-cut than I remembered, but the article makes it plain that Force Unleashed, at least, outranked novels. http://archive.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/16-09/ff_starwarscanon?currentPage=all"
iama,"Hey Mr. bridges.  There are two characters I will always remember you as The Dude and Burt Vickerman.  Stick It handsome serious undertones that are very applicable real life situations.  Children stuck between unhappy divorced parents , dealing with why that happened, finding a happy medium between quarreling parents,  being forced into sports even if there was good intention, and most importantly coming to terms with what is out of their control.  My question really relates to Burt's situation of being a washed up coach that no one in the field took seriously and having to help a trouble teenager get not only her life back on track but help his.  I don't even know how to phrase the question but how did you go about portraying the character while trying to conveying the message of good things come out of tough situations?"
askreddit,"around 3 1/2 years, from when they moved in to now. They still maintain a 'presence' (there's always someone's car there), but the noise and harassment level has gone down to about zero since being called out on the meth.

Funny, Obese Gypsy dude once served a 'burn' on the SO, telling him ""Hey, you should just go back to Mexico where you came from!"". My SO is half Japanese.

This industry is greatly varied and a mechanic's specialty all depends on what and where you want to work.  In addition, there is different specialties within each body type.  You have Avionics, systems, structures, composite and interiors mechanics amongst others.  You can also specialize in reciprocating or turbine engines.  You may choose to work in a back shop repairing and refurbishing components.  I could keep going but I hope this relates to your question. "
iama,"I stood along side many honorable Iraqis and consider a few friends.  Wissam, Reshad, Samo.  

You should probably ask your policy makers who choose war as a first response and engage in war lightly as to why folks like me end up in ambiguous environments with questionable missions.

Maybe question the honor of these same policy makers who dismiss the lives of people on a tv screen 8,000 miles away and use missiles they never touched as their foreign policy.

Trust me, I'm not picking to go to war if I can find another means... but those with the power to make war don't think like me, and those who do don't vote."
iama,"1. Hardly any. A very popular rumor about us, though, and I'm sure it's the thrust of what you're asking, is that the purpose of our organization is to piss people off, beat us, and then collect money. You know, I don't necessarily mind that lie being there, because it tells people to not put their hands on us. But, very little money, and it's definitely not a profit. When my mother was falsely arrested, we used all of that money to fund more trips.

2. Eh, none really stands out, honestly. A lot of people, as I'm sure you can imagine, have gotten quite crazy, but I trust in God.

3. The banter between fellow WBC members? I don't know. We've seen some strange people. 

4. We don't communicate with them.

5. The marriage bed is undefiled."
iama,"Not sure who you're talking about when you say us, because the north korean people have absolutely no want to fight. One of the major issues here is the politically blind-eye towards what the north korean government is doing. And in my experience the people who have been to north korea cite the fact that there is almost NO cultural exchange with a country that is so deeply embedded in it's own tiny fortress of solitude. There is no doubt that having the north korean people see eye-to-eye with us as humans is a good idea, but where exactly are they getting this experience? Because one teacher is providing little to influence the people's opinion of us when they have all other contact with americans shut off."
iama,"Thank you for the compliment!

It would be possible to make one, yes. Perhaps I will. I've still got a few things planned but it's hard to arrange time. I need more willing female subs, or at least more in my timezone *smiles*.

Can a baby be hypnotized; yes to a point. I'd say that it's very possible to 'mesmerize' a baby with various things, but it's of course incredibly hard to give any suggestions without language. But rocking, for example, is a natural trigger used to help calm someone down and used by all parents. :)"
worldnews,"I wouldn't really agree with the way you're putting that. I wouldn't want to go topless in public......Because people would stare and judge me, or even make me feel threatened. If boobs in western culture were only as notable as elbows or hands I would have no problem with it. There's a difference between liking where the line is drawn, and not wanting to be treated like meat. I won't speak for women in other cultures in regard to head coverings but I know western cultures often DO have women voice their discontent with the double standard, and do nothing to change it because there is no way to go topless and not be judged horrendously."
worldnews,"At the end of WWII, my dad's cousin was a soldier in the German army and hitler had just committed suicide.  He and his unit were still fighting in Czechoslovakia according to him waiting to surrender to American forces.  Russians were advancing, and they would have fought them to the death because they knew the Russians would torture them.   Believing the Americans would not, they surrendered to American troops without so much as a shot.  However, those American troops were Russians in American uniforms.

Torture does not produce good intel, it produces bad intel, *and* historically it costs the lives of soldiers on the side doing the torturing.  So a good question is: how many US soldiers have died for the unproductive CIA torture program?"
worldnews,"All sorts of dreams are used to sell products. Good looking people with riches and smiles on their faces sell us everything from toothpaste to cars to religion. People have sex drives. Men look at women with wanting. It's natural. People size each other up and judge and compare. It's human nature. Hiding in a ghost costume doesn't liberate, it puts you in a cage. It makes me think of people who live online instead of real life for fear of some judgement that might be passed on them in the real world.  
I respect that you have the right to do whatever you want to, but to hear you describe the culture as holding women equal to men and women walking around in cloth jails because it's liberating and not because a bunch of men say God demands it? Not buying it. "
worldnews,"Because firstly the US is still a net importer of crude products. That means they need to make up the shortfall by buying oil on the global markets. The estimates out there are 0.3% lost GDP for every $10 in price hike. If Arab countries cut production, as they did in 1973, that comes out of the global pool and prices skyrocket and the economy tanks. The other thing is the US economy is heavily interlinked with the rest of the world, so even if they were totally oil secure there would be a lot of pain as the rest of the world went under. "
science,"I'm not sure you read my answer carefully, it *is* a defense even at first, just not a good one.  

Even if both plants are getting eaten, predators will have a preference to eat those which are non-proto-thorn bearing, as they are more easily taken, which puts selective pressure on favoring the ones with proto-thorns, even if they're not perfect.

Even as they are now, a rose's thorns aren't ""ideal"" as there is no evolutionary perfection.  Wouldn't roses be *better* protected if they had ten inch thorns?  Perhaps so, but pressure doesn't dictate that type of evolution currently, and the current thorn size is what is able to be done via current variation in their genome.  

Any difference, no matter how small, can be acted on if there is a detectable phenotypic difference.  "

iama,"You're probably right. We know everything at TH is frozen and (last time I was in one) KK was making the donuts fresh in front of you.

Instinctively I assume fresh=natural/healthy(it's a donut... ok... forget that one)/unprocessed and I assume frozen=extra chemicals/colourings/preservatives

But

a) we don't know what goes into the KK dough... it could easily have a tonne of preservatives in it

b) frozen vegetables are (or at least can be) healthier than fresh vegetables because they're frozen close to the picking time whereas a fresh vegetable has gone days between when it's picked and when you eat it. I'm not sure if KK's dough is made on-site or shipped in.

What I'm trying to say is that ""fresh vs frozen"" doesn't necessarily have to tie directly to ""natural vs full-of-preservatives"". Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

Most of the stuff we work with is low enough power and won't hurt ya.   The high power stuff has interlocks to shut off the laser if the path is broken.  Also, we've moved away from directly viewing fibers to check for cleanliness and now use indirect video scopes. So, you really have to try to hurt yourself. "
worldnews,"Get used to it.  I came from the same societal background as you as far as circumcisions go and not only did our hospital support doing it but so did several standing medical studies at the time.  The trend is reversing in America BECAUSE people are becoming more informed and medical professionals are changing their minds.  Unfortunately on Reddit it can't stand at, studies show no great difference either way, so we shouldn't do it.  It has to be the WORST THING EVER.  Instead every time female circumcision comes up everyone pretends like its an equivalent to male circumcision or that talking about female circumcision means you don't care about male circumcision.  And for the love of god don't admit to being a circumcised male and use your own experiences as a reference point."

You didn't take kindly to it, tried to argue, but the deed was done.  And then how you handled it was the nail in the coffin for ever appearing on her show again.  

My question is - have you gotten another invite to her show - or some other Beltway show like hers - since the Bridge?  Have you experienced any kind of professional shunning on mainstream venues because your decorum wasn't say in line with David Brooks?"

How many takes did it take usually to film a scene, and were you able to do them with a straight face? It seems like there would be a lot of cracking up with that script!

Also, having watched your films where you take on a more southern accent, I was really surprised to hear your actual voice was several beats higher than I expected it to be! You seriously need to do more films like True Grit and Crazy Heart because you are incredible in those types of roles.

Finally, I heard that you have been trying to get *The Giver* off the ground for a pretty long while, what finally clicked to make the film take off this time? Do you think that book readers will be happy with the final product?

ISIS for instance is not a representation of Islam yet the media protrays them as such, but the KKK (who btw have been around for over 200yrs) wasn't a representation of Catholic Christianity.

worldnews,"Give me a break, man, I'm not an idiot.

AI is used as shorthand for a lot of things. Self-driving cars are not real AI, nor is anything else we've developed. Real AI is actual artificial intelligence. Professors at colleges may play semantic games, but they will admit that they haven't created actual artificial intelligence, nor are they likely to anytime soon.

Musk wasn't warning against self-driving cars or anything we've made so far that people call artificial intelligence. He's warning about developing real artificial intelligence, a sentient being that is artificial.

The people in the field ""artificial intelligence"" would agree that they aren't making artificial intelligence, just simulating some of it, but in the end all they are doing is creating a lot of if:then statements.

When Hollywood talks about AI as an artificial thinking being like the fictional comic book Ultron, they are being more correct in their semantics than you are."

science,"Alan Rickinson:

There is some evidence emerging that EBV can induce hypermethylation of the infected cell genome. This mainly comes from cell culture experiments where one of the virus’ transforming proteins, latent membrane protein1 (LMP1) has been expressed in epithelial cells and shown to up-regulate one or more of the cell’s DNA-methyltransferase enzymes. EBV-positive stomach cancer (these make up about 10% of all stomach cancers) has a specific methylation signature not seen in EBV-unrelated stomach cancers, so that’s another indication. 

The vaccine we are delivering will not directly infect tumour cells, and so it’s hard to see how it could affect the tumours’ epigenome

For example, If I wanted to condition myself to spend less time on the computer (gaming, browsing reddit, watching streams/videos, etc.), according to this article I have a higher chance at succeeding if I precommit (which already sounds obvious) and even higher if it threatens my finances, correct? Or am I understanding this article incorrectly?

I guess what I'm trying to get at is this: you're an entrepreneur-- why do I need your product? I'm talking specifically *your product*. Why is *your product* the best way to break habits?

science,"If you're talking about phylogenetics, you can look at mutation rates as a way to ""keep track"" of how much time has passed.  So assuming mutations occur across nucleotides over such and such amount of time lets you say, okay, we see this many mutations, so we can assume that this amount of time has passed by.  

There's many other methods, for sure, but that's a simplistic way to look at it.  

Also recall that the different species are essentially a human construct.  Life is a continuum, so the species are broken down in a way that fits a human definition, such as unable to reproduce and create viable, fertile offspring (as per the Biological Species Concept) for example."
iama,"My boyfriend and I are known as ""Tomato guy"" and ""Tomato guy's girlfriend"" at our subway.

One day they were going back and forth and I just had to stop them and be like ""Listen lady. You are the only one in this subway that won't make my boyfriend's god damn sandwich the way he wants it. We come in 5 times a week. I will tell your manager that you are the reason the store lost a couple of regulars and I will tell him it was over a couple of tomatos. Just make the damn sandwich.""

How does the just in time model work? I understand the principle of the idea and why you do it but surely it requires the guys you buy from to be either very close by and/or to have a very efficient shipping business. What's to stop them doing what you are doing rather than B2B work.  It sounds like they have most things in place to do so.

What sort of  deliverying ine do you offer then with just in time  parts?

How have you set up your website for searching for parts? I have a Land Rover Defender and more often than not on parts websites I need to know the part number to get anywhere on their website but often I just want to browse around and look at the various accessories and just see what the options are, I suppose a bit like Amazon.  I can understand the part number search though. "

Inhibiting cortisol would be an interesting treatment, though I am skeptical that just inhibiting cortisol would work without elevation of other hormones.

So this can happen, that is great. But one thing I would have to say for my parents: they never looked down on those who did not rise. They understood the problems. They didn't say ""oh, we're better than the people we left behind in our old community in Butte.""

I come from a technical background studying Economics at uni and working in Analytics for a few years before transferring to HR. Although, Analytics and Business Intelligence is much more complex and traditionally more difficult to understand than HR; it is a completely different skillset. I cannot overestimate the importance of a functional/effective HR Manager/team.

People skills cannot always be taught or learnt. It somes natural to some and not to others. Good HR Managers aare used to diffuse situations. Manipulate the workforce if you like. They turn potential ""issues"" into nothing with a few well placed words in a meeting. There is a horrendous impression of HR Managers in the general population and I realise that there are some seriously poor examples out there, but I assure you, HR done properly is absolutely invaluable to an organisation."

I am one of the authors of the new diversity legislation being brought to MUSG in the next few weeks.

The 'tl;dr' of the amendment is to create a new legislative position - and corresponding council - for Diversity, Inclusion, and Social Justice.  The goal of this committee is to represent students who have concerns pertaining to diversity on campus and to be a powerful legislative voice for them.

With that, I have a few questions..

1) What is your opinion on the formation of this position/council?

2) What would you like to see this council accomplish on campus if this amendment passed?"

worldnews,"I wonder if [this tweet](https://twitter.com/spainbuca/status/489813837013848065) is correct, that the plane was escorted by two fighters just minutes before it was shot down.

Such thing would explain why the plane was shot down, and possibly why it was confused to be something else than passenger plane. Then again, who knows what is accurate information in this sort of horrible disaster, except the fact that nearly 300 people got killed :(

Also, apparently the separatists claim that the plane was shot down by fighters (Unfortunately cannot find any other news source for this than finnish one)."

Yes they are.

Kind of disagreeing with yourself. 

&gt; Patents on new products are a multi year affair with patents being extended for bogus reformulations done just different enough to qualify it as a new product

If there's no improvement, you're free to use the old one for a fraction of the price. Care to cite an actual medicine? I'm not a shill, you're just a moron.

You think so because?

&gt; I think they use sidewalks just as much, go to school just as much, cross bridges just as much, etc.

Again what makes you think this?"
worldnews,"he might be alive 

&gt;airline buffs have since pointed out that Pan the photo is actually of a different Boeing 777-200.

&gt;The plane in the Facebook photo has a registration number 9M-MRC - as indicated by the ""RC"" under the nose wheel.

&gt;The downed plane was 9M-MRD.

&gt;Another clue that the photo is of the wrong plane is that Pan posted the photo a full hour and a half before MH17 took off, according to Flightradar24.

&gt;Earlier this week Pan posted photos to his Facebook page of his vacation and said he was in Indonesia, even though the post was location-stamped to the Netherlands.

&gt;If that's the case Pan is likely in for a shock the next time he connects his phone to the internet.

Humans enjoy a MUCH longer period of old age than any cow that is making its owner money, and thus I would conclude that this study does nothing to prove the safety of human consumption by drawing a parallel with its safety in livestock consuming GE feed.

I know you aren't implying this, but I don't doubt that pro GE people are going to try and point to this study as evidence."

The problem that automation solves is over population, not production. If you need less people to produce then you simply need less people overall. I'd rather live in the world of 1 to 3 billion people with massive forests and abundant wildlife than the world of 20 billion hell hole. 

It's a fantasy land scenario anyway. What is the incentive for your doctor or surgeon to work if they were magically provided things and could stay home? 

There's no reasonable thought process behind this fantasy of robots producing and everyone ""having everything"", it's simply greed and laziness from the under educated.

It was easy to sensationalize the police against the protesters, but having been there during that moment, there's a lot the media and detractors left out to make it seem as bad as possible, such as the protestors **surrounding the police because they arrested one protestor, chanting, ""We will let you go if you let them go,""** as well as being told several times that if they do not move and stop obstructing the public path, they will be pepper sprayed.

It didn't help that they were erecting what they called ""spirit domes"" on the quad without permission, and that a large chunk of the protests weren't even from the school but came from outside the region. It's one thing for the paying students to openly protest, but another when they become enmeshed with people from outside the institution."

That's a very self-implication admission, because it's also an admission that he could have done a lot without Congress in, say, 2010! But he didn't. Because he remained enamored to the fantasy that the Republicans were negotiating partners he could work with. That's a historical tragedy, a failure of intellectual discernment, and a political failure we'll be reckoning with for a generation to come. It reveals his basic strategy for governing the country to have been a failure. FDR wasn't perfect. Obama is much much much much worse. He's not good at his job."

I often give the example of the grease barrel in the motor pool…I don't even know if it's ever been seen on camera, but we wanted to ensure the NSN for a 50-gal drum of grease was correct. That's just one example of how dedicated the team was to getting the details. Also though…berets. We are quite proud of how the berets looked last week in the parade episode.

Now, your daughter has 1 in 8 chance of getting breast cancer. And there's around a 2-7% chance that this will be fatal.

Did you remove your daughters breast tissue while it is simple and she's young ?

You might fail and feel crummy, but you'd feel even more crummy if you're not comfortable doing those skills when it matters. 

Losing fat and weight training go hand in hand. Keep up with resistance training (i.e. heavy-ish weights) and start doing some HIIT (high intensity interval training, lots of resources) on your non-lifting days. 

Depending on how much you're carrying around, you should be able to lose fat and gain some muscle mass.

&gt;Russia is a first world country, you are quite far from starving to death.

I'm far from starving to death because my family has assets and my job pays well for as long as I have it. But I do get around enough to know that I'm an exception.

I think the worst thing I ever saw online is a video of a guy on what was maybe a four story rooftop with a dog, where the guy grabs this happy, unsuspecting dog by the tail and throws it over the side of the building and then laughs about it with the person filming. The sound that dog made after it hit the ground and realized the pain it was in is one of the most haunting and heartbreaking things I've ever heard.

When you put something in your mouth you begin the digestive process. The food moves into your stomach which contains acids that break down the food. From there the broken down food moves into the small intestine, the small intestine absorbs the nutrients contained in what you ate. What is left over moves into your large intestine which removes the water. What is left over is what you shit out. 

You can't shove food up a person's ass and expect their body to process it. It simply does not work that way. Any doctor who thinks the large intestine can digest food needs to be stripped of their credentials and sent back to highschool.

My psychiatrist then asked me if I ever thought about killing animal, or other things about touching myself when thinkng about x, can't remember. Needless to say, I fessed up and said I didn't really answer or read all the questions and just filled in the blanks.

Like someone said above about asking for a 9/11 instead. Do you feel like people who were affected by that would be choosing to be offended by being reminded/made fun of something that had a traumatic impact on their life? I don't think so.

I wrote my Senior Thesis in undergrad on Dengue fever last year, and it seems that they're really open to anything if it means progress.  This, if anything, offers researchers a place in the pathway that they can interrupt to prevent people from picking up these pathogens.  And, for Dengue alone, that could be huge.  Antibody dependent enhancement, where a person catches a second infection of Dengue after already having it, is devastatingly lethal and not very uncommon.  Preventing it could be huge."

iama,"Another Irishman in The States here. The alcohol per capita statistic is misleading towards the way in which alcohol is consumed in Europe. Germans will drink a beer with lunch and dinner every day. Irish people generally don't drink while eating, wont drink every day and when they do drink tend to binge drink more in one evening. 

I'm also at a major American university (UGA a high ranked party school). I don't think the drinking here is worse than back in Ireland but it is a lot cheaper. 1.25L of Vodka costs rougbly $11 here back in Ireland it would be around the $40 mark (after converting from Euros). You can get beers in a bar here for a dollar! See what would happen if you tried that in Ireland.

science,"Because when you give poor people lots of money, massive inflation happens and goods remain the same price relative to the new wealth standard.

Also there's plenty that needs to be done domestically. If you send the money abroad, it increases international supply of the dollar, which decreases demand for the dollar, which makes the dollar less valuable, which makes things cost more dollars. Which might be a good thing because Walmart products made in China would cost more money and so people would buy more domestic stuff. Oh wait, China artificially and illegally pegs the yuan to the dollar. So no it wouldn't really.

Give a man a fish, teach a man to fish, etc etc.

And you know, how do you give that money to poor people? You know what happens when we donate food to poor people in Africa? Warlords and gangsters seize it all and get richer, while the starving people keep starving. Any reason you think money would be any different?"

With monsanto seeds you're guaranteed resistance and a predictable level of crop quality which makes it far more efficient for farmers to simply buy the seeds from them.

Sure blanket herbicides aren't the best for the environment but it's the best for the farmer from a financial standpoint. Being able to spray your entire field and ensure that all the weeds are gone is very attractive. "

Women tear on each other constantly, but whatever, they're relatively easy to intimidate. If one does start becoming a problem just find the woman in the group that hates them the most and gently give them a hand.

I was under absolutely no religious or traditional pressure from family or friends  - this was purely in discussion with his doctors.  It was a decision about risk, sanitation, cleanliness, and risk of fungal infection from  where we live.  What others would think didn't factor into it.

And for the record, I'm NOT cut, and I'm happy with that. I didn't take this decision lightly, and I still have twinges of doubt now and then - but I made the best possible decision I could at the time.

Now.. FGM? That's never in the guise of health. It's pure tradition... and that make sit worng. I would nEVERT have had my son cut for religious or cultural reasons... and to me, those reasons should be invalid.

askreddit,"Kill them with kindness. The only reason someone is bullying you is because he is jealous of you being better than him in some way or because she has a crush on you. Having been bullied a lot when I was younger, it's natural to want immediate satisfaction or revenge, but just encourage him to be the bigger man. It's never easy, but it's always worth it and he'll be able to look back proudly at the way he handled himself at such a young age. It's probably not the advice he wants to hear, but it's the advice my father gave me and it's proved 100% true for him and again for myself."

Your comparisons are nonsense. It goes on the premise of:

 1) you can't compare them. 

2) I'll show you can't compare them by comparing them 

3) Ensures the point that you just compared them to show they are unable to be compared goes over your head no matter how many times it is pointed out.

All that is presented is circular reasoning mixed with some confirmation bias. You've had an attempt and you are not convincing on the subject at all.

Overall they of course putting all forms of genital modification together is appropriate and yes they can be compared (after all you compared them yourself). But if you don't appreciate this maybe you should stick to only talking about FGM in topics such as these rather than telling other people what they can and can't discuss in relation to a topic."
science,"  I have two step children who are diagnosed with autism, one carries my last name the other calls me dad. I was present for both of their births. I remain present in their lives simply so that they have a consistent father.

  Both children exhibit a wide range of emotions. They don't seem to understand social boundaries though.

My question for the both of you:

**What made you pick up the instruments that you play now?**

**Kate, you play several other instruments, what made you choose the ukulele, seeing that some other people treat it like a toy or as Jake Shimabukuro would put it, it's the ""underdog of all the instruments"".** 

I actually play the ukulele also and you're one of the ukulele players I look up to! So I'd like to know your story. :D

Thank you so much!"

&gt;* The ""architect"" of the CIA's interrogation program, James Mitchell, accused Senate Democrats of putting his life in danger last week when they released a report detailing the program's ""brutal"" abuses.

&gt;* However, the Republican minority accused the Senate report of having partisan bias against the program.

&gt;* The Senate report presented even more shocking techniques and previously undisclosed details from the program. Among other things, the report found that forced rectal feeding, diapers, and insects were used against detainees.

todayilearned,"The initial WHO study had positive results, and individual studies have been a mixed bag. I think it's important to consider the limitations to a study like this. For instance, there's no control of subjects for the study. Additionally, studying infection rates in illicit drug users is subject to participation and sample size. Also, people that use NSPs are generally in higher risk areas, which can skew the data. 

Personally, NSPs make prefect sense to me. There was a huge drop in infections and mortality when people started sterilizing medical equipment, so why would providing clean needles not work in the same way? "
iama,"People act like they are fascinated with this as if it was a kind of amusement park, as travelling to Nazi Germany but being able to ignore the Concentration Camps, the Smoke, the trains… It is sickening once you read what really happens in the Camps in North Korea, and not like in “in the distant past” but right now. They fall in love with the uniformity without knowing what the price behind such effect is. 
The ability of people to ignore terrible things as long as they don’t see them directly or know the revolting details is astounding. Who would doubt that helping Nazi Germany wouldn’t be a good idea for such an inhuman regime, but when it comes to North Korea, people think is a kind of a fascinating anecdote to tell, a joke or simple point of view -among many- to forget after a hollow comment.

askreddit,"This is a hot topic right now in the impulse control world. There's a debate of what causes these sorts of disorders and some are hypothesizing that it is due to the neural connections in the orbitofrontal cortex. Anxiety doesn't seem to be a cause, rather a comorbidity. The most striking findings are the family element to it all. It's fairly common for impulse control disorders (especially nail biting, skin picking and hairpulling) to run in families and to be expressed as one or more of those disorders. It's all really interesting! There are going to be some great articles coming out by the end of the year on this topic, I believe. "
iama,"I worked for a Tim's in Newfoundland this summer. The worst work experience I have had. Everyone hated working their, the management had no idea what they were doing, and you had to deal with shitty customers on top of shitty fellow co-workers. I believe most of the people hired didn't even go through an interview process. The week after I left for school 13 other workers put in their two-weeks notice because of how terrible it was.

I'm sure for me it was mainly the people working there. Other than that it is an easy job."
science,The headline is over simplifying a complex argument and doesnt really answer anything aside from the fact that cows were fed two different kinds of corn through out two different periods of time and surprise surprise the results showed there wasn't much difference between the end product. Though I'm a bit curious what signs of bad health were left out of the study under a static or environmental category because any one who has ever been to a damn feed lot would not call those animals healthy. Maybe the corn didn't have any negative side effects it was probably just all the shit the things were rolling around in.
worldnews,"It starts by stating that ""It's not actually about The Interview offending Kim Jong Un"" then further down the page it says ""North Korea's anger over The Interview gives the Hermit Kingdom a clear motive for the attacks."" Which is it?

Also the idea that parts of the code was written in Korean could just mean South Koreans did it. Last time I checked they hate everything Japanese and they might associate Sony Entertainment with its parent company in Japan. Or it could be anyone trying to pin the blame on NK.

If GOP was really NK do you really think they would concede to allow the film to be shown with minor edits to the end? I think not. They'd scrap the entire thing and demand Sony Entertainment make propaganda movies for them instead. Didn't NK kidnap a South Korean director just to have him make a movie? If they really had their hands on Sony they'd be making bigger demands.

Also, why would they censor the Interview if they secretly WANT to be thought of as crazy nuts? "

todayilearned,"In Italy, all Tolkien lore is vastly used and appreciated by neo fascist groups. They name themselves after the books and organize events, seminar and camps based on the books.

The earliest form of the Phoenician alphabet found to date is the inscription on the sarcophagus of King Ahiram of Byblos. (The Sumerian Temple Hymns). The Epic of Gilgamesh from Sumer, with origins as early as 2150-2000 BCE, is also one of the earliest literary works that includes various mythological figures. The Rigveda of Hinduism is proposed to have been composed between 1700–1100 BCE making it possibly the world's oldest religious text still in use. The oldest portions of the Zoroastrian Avesta are believed to have been transmitted orally for centuries before they found written form, and although widely differing dates for Gathic Avestan (the language of the oldest texts) have been proposed, scholarly consensus floats at around 1000 BCE.*

He may be powerful in Russia but that's about where it ends, a good percentage of American's might not like Obama but when it comes down to a crisis situation or act of war, the whole country tends to unite together and support the leader despite what political party they are backed by. Obama weilds a serious amount of military, economic and cultural power that Putin will never get close to. His influence on the world's affaris is vastly more extensive. Not only that but Obama has the support of all the NATO nations (pretty much all the European countries) supporting.

science,"Yeah, heritability is in general badly understood in the popular press and very widely misused.  Heritability can have nothing to do with genetics if the mechanism of trait transfer is due to parental care or correlation between parental and offspring environment (as the article points out, accent and location are both heritable), and heritability also depends greatly on the environment itself...measure the exact same trait in a group of animals all raised in a similar environment, and heritability will be high, but raise those same animals in a variable environment, and heritability will be lower.

worldnews,"Firstly, I'd like to note that I'm not placing blame with any particular party or saying that this was definitely an incident where the plane was shot down.

With that said, the plane was in the older Malysia Airlines livery, which has the bottom of the fuselage and engine nacelles painted grey. Perhaps this could contribute to it being mistaken for a military transport by inexperienced or trigger-happy forces, as it would be a similar color to that used on those transports.

I hope the truth of this incident can be found without politics getting in the way on every side. The crew and passengers deserve it."

One major challenge is being able identify and diagnose people with AD MUCH earlier than when they first present with symptoms because research is showing that even we had a drug that treats the root cause of AD...giving people the drug at the late stages of the disease cannot reverse the damage done already. So people are searching for a simple blood test or diagnostic that will help identify who needs treatment very early on. Indeed, many of the current AD trials have failed because of this I believe. "
worldnews,"I was talking about this issue in the car with my wife yesterday: from a modern perspective, it's hard to imagine how so much of the world, especially the US, could have followed a strategy of 'appeasement' for so long into WWII, in the face of German atrocities and aggression.  Looking at the situation today, though, and knowing that a military confrontation with Russia could conceivably lead to a nuclear war which could effectively wipe out human civilization across half the globe... it's a lot easier to understand the appeal of 'appeasement.'

Some Muslims put strong emphasis on some hadiths, while others consider different hadith more important - some only looks to the Q'uran (as it must be the final authority since it was written by God himself). Some Muslims doesn't care much and just follow the customs they were brought up in. Some doesn't even read the Q'uran but still feel that they are 'culturally Muslim'. The list continues for a long time yet, but you get the idea. There are more than *one billion* Muslims out there and they are far more culturally diverse than many people think - including Muslims."

So one day everybody was hanging out outside and all of the kids were playing duck duck goose. The guy comes home speeds down the street as usual and goes inside. About 10 minutes later he goes inside, opens a window, and starts blasting porn out of the windows. All to stop kids from playing in our front yard. I was 14 so I knew what was up and went inside to get away from it. Police were called because this guy was a a douche.

iama,"Think outside the box. Your assumption is that the only way for technology to progress is for us to progress in aerodynamics? It could be something as simple as automated rolling ground stations filled with pesticides and batteries that the drones are programmed to land on when they need to refill/recharge. The drones would neither have to fly far or carry heavy loads in order to complete their tasks. The same technology we currently use for cell phone positioning with cell towers, could be utilized in the fields by adding small tracking towers that would allow the drones to always know their exact position. Without the need for human interaction as eventually the drones would be able to work without it, the drones could work 24/7 shifts in their duties.

I tried contacting the school district several times following the shooting and was never called back.

Second, the child who brought shot the gun admitted to investigators that he was protecting himself - why would a 9-year old bring gun to protect themselves at school?

The amount of smog that fills Beijing is unbelievable so if anything they are rapidly catching up to us.  This study just seems like a study directly made to make the US look bad.  Over time for what the US has done compared to what the rest of the world is doing now should be the current study.  With things like nuclear power plants being submerged in water and china having so much smog you can't see the sky, I would say those would be more major contributing factors then just the time that the US has been industrialized.

Just to be clear, SELF REPORTED drug use increased. Sure, you might use those stats at face value and bend them to support an anti-drug viewpoint.

OR

You could read this and use some critical thinking to realize only good is coming from legalization: 

""It has been proposed that this effect may have been related to the candor of interviewees, who may have been inclined to answer more truthfully due to a reduction in the stigma associated with drug use""

So yes, self-reported drug use increased, but if you think that's a bad thing(the fact people can be honest and find the help they need) you are seriously fucked in the head.

After doing farm work, I like it, and it's a great payoff if you get to use the land to hunt, but it takes a special person to do that as a living. A farmer is one of the best friends you'll ever have. "

Some of those roles include logisticians, water and sanitation specialists, psychologists, financial coordinators and administrators and more. Our combined Ebola teams are now made up of more than 3,000 people, working under relentlessly challenging conditions.

iama,"Make some money on the side:

Usually Subway counts their sandwiches sold by the bread count. So if you start in the morning with 100 pieces of bread and have 75 by end of day then you sold 25 sandwiches. If any sandwiches are messed up or bread is stale they are tossed in a bad bread bin which is thrown away at night.

Here is what to do: Take the bread from the bad bin and put it back in the proofer and tell your boss you threw the bad bin bread away. Anways this will inflate your count in the monrning to however many breads were moved from the bad bin. Therefore any sandwiches sold , the cash can be pocketed. When the end of the day comes and just toss the ""Bad Bread"" that was moved to the proofer in the morning back into the bad bin and repeat. 

Value meals make more than just sandwiches, so save the pocketing for the people who add on a lot of side items."

The symbol was most likely swapped-out because of its striking resemblance to the symbol of Islam. Obviously, having the bad-guys of the game represented by this symbol was in poor taste (as was having to physically step on the symbol countless times throughout the game).

There are metals, such as uranium, which are rare and have great intrinsic value.  But until recent history, it was valueless, because even though it was rare it was unremarkable so no one cared.

science,"Pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizer were all prevalent before GM crops were widely available. GE crops were designed to reduce the use of pesticides while increasing yield, and were incredibly successful in that regard. Furthermore, organic farming doesn't really rule out monoculture growing processes or the use of pesticides. So your conflation of the two doesn't make an argument defending the safety of GM crops a ""red-herring,"" it means you've failed to distinguish between several arguments and models of agriculture. 

You want everyone to move to permaculture, fine. Advocate for that. But if people nest that viewpoint inside anti-science rhetoric, it makes that argument waaaaay less compelling."

todayilearned,"There were no animals to pull because they hadn't domesticated any animals to pull. Oxes, horses, and mules are all bred from their wild counterparts. And you really can't compare North American fauna (deer, bison, muskox, caribou, elk, mountain goats, etc.) with our modern domesticated animals, as they lack the thousands of years of  breeding we have put them through. ""Bison are too aggressive!"" is not really an argument considering the accounts of wild aurochs, the species that most cattle in the world were bred from, tell us they could be [just as aggressive as American bison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs#Ecology_and_behaviour). 

Clearly, the aggressiveness had to be ""bred out"" of them."

science,"So, you're implying that, over time, that a bacterium such as *agrobacterium tumefaciens* will happen to combine its own DNA with that of soybeans, or corn? Because normally this would never happen (perhaps over a few million years, but evidence of this naturally happening would be great to see, [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup_Ready_soybean) is a link explaining how it happens by human interference). 

Traditional cultivation has not involved extracting DNA from a different species (or class, or family) or organisms, to be planted in another. Yes, humans have hybridized thousands of plants before, but we're talking about plants. Not bacteria, mammals, fish, plus plants. "

worldnews,"It's a law that seeks to preserve social cohesion. Expression plays a major role in promoting social cohesion, otherwise, we wouldn't have such recognizable expressions. Expressions allow people to interact on a more open level, which happens to be the defining characteristic of western culture: openness. This openness is why we have reached levels of prosperity, social justice, etc. that hadn't been reached in humanity previously. In fact, it probably explains why you support a social trend that threatens your way of life. Openness is usually a good thing, but it sometimes requires more objectivity and diverse perspectives "

Sidenote: When our base opened up during the Friendship Festival and Bon Odori Festival, the Japanese would line up at our pizza place on base and buy three to six pizzas a person and take them home. Pretty much, I think, because they're so cheap and large compared to what they get outside the gate. Whenever the base opened to the public, you'd see Anthony's Pizza set up a tent with stacks and stacks of pizzas in boxes ready to ship out.

I ended up being very perfunctory with male customers, especially when I worked at a gym.  Nothing like having a strange man come behind the counter and put his hands on you, even when you aren't being very nice or inviting of such behavior.

I noticed that they worked harder than the guys that tried to help them.

If I was rich, I would give my child/children everything I could. I would not want them to want, or need anything in life. I would want them to live easy because I worked hard.

askreddit,"Elements of direct democracy actually exist in Switzerland today. Don't know too much about it but a quick search online seems to suggest that any Swiss citizen can propose changes to the Swiss constitution and if such a proposal gains 100,000 signatures it goes to a referendum. 

Additionally, citizens can call legislative referendums on laws already passed (ie. they can't draft their own laws and vote on them) which seems to require 50,000 signatures in order to initiate voting. I assume this allows to populace to veto laws they dislike

Given that Switzerland is a fairly successful nation I would say this is evidence enough that direct democracy (or elements of it) are plausible.

In my opinion the key to a successful direct democracy would be an engaged and informed electorate. For example in Switzerland, voting is possible via mail or the traditional booth option and does not require voter registration    "

When the person you replied to originally drew a parallel, it was pretty accurate. This is because most things are extreme and alien to us in several Muslim countries.

Because, their laws are universally similar. If they functioned as we do, but still forced women to wear X clothing it would make sense. Because in our society, beating and killing a women over that would be an outlying law, well beyond the norm. However their laws are different, and often harsh against all sorts of people... men and women included.

In the very beginning it has a tag ""Сообщение от ополчения"" which means ""Message from militia"" (or separatists, depending on whether you like them or not).

The post since has been deleted, whether because the blog is pro-separatist or because the information was incorrect - I don't know. In my opinion it's the former, but do not quote me on that, I have no real evidence to support it."

You would still need to go about *losing* that trait, but without selective pressure, traits can be lost in a population, just like other traits can disappear.  A good example of this would be how selective pressure to *keep* scent detection traits (sorry, I'm an animal behaviorist/ecologist, so all my examples are non-petri dish) was very high when tetrapods first appeared on land, but those traits quickly disappeared in some mammals (e.g. whales and other cetaceans) as they returned to the ocean.

Bonus question: While this is a very heated discussion in some parts of the hypnosis world. My opinion is very simple; your mind must be able to make it out to process it. However, it doesn't have to be so clear that your short-term memory can store it.

Tracks that use multiple layers are intended to distract your focus. It works well for some, horrible on others. There is no ""should"" in those cases though. It's all up to you and your mind.

Alcohol just happens to be the one thing they do have a quantifiable measurement for. Roadside tests, while subjective, are standardized to a point where officers can reasonably determine the level of impairment. Furthermore, there is specialized training available for police to become certified Drug Recognition Experts. The purpose of the training is to more readily identify the drug causing impairment based upon specific indicators from the field test. If the DRE shows up and determines impairment, that leads to an arrest and subsequent confirmation via lab test. Test  results coupled with DRE testimony will generally hold up in court. Besides, if a police pulls someone over and determines that the driver is not impaired, send them on their way. There is no need for an numeric confirmation- if they want to get you off the road, they will. "

And these women tend to be second or third generation French simply rebelling against an unjust law. These laws have nothing to do with protection of women (again we have laws for that) it has everything to do with attacking a minority which practice customs unwelcome by local populations. "

My read from his responses: during the years he was waiting for some sort of criminal justice, pre-occupied with treatment for his daughter, and during litigation, he felt felt muzzled from fully responding to the developing media narrative of what exactly happened, and the community harassment his family experienced. Now that he's moved passed some of it all, he wanted to tell his story (his doubts about the shooter's narrative, how rough the community harassment was, his family's ongoing struggles, etc)"

todayilearned,"Not entirely sure if troll, but yes I do. It's supply and demand. When the demand stays the same, but the supply is controlled by a few unregulated sources, profitability skyrockets. Legalizing and (heavily) regulating drugs would crash the black market for them in the same way Walmart spells the apocalypse for all small businesses in a large radius of where a new location opens up. Walmart has lower prices, better advertizing, better networking, more legal power, has the profit-margin enhancing power to bulk-buy, mass transit and mass-produce for a pittance on the dollar, is convenient and generally predictable as far as quality due to the standards it has to adhere to as a massive vendor. Mom and Pop generally can't compete."
worldnews,"Also the ""War on Child Porn/Human Trafficking"". We had a case in our state where an old man was caught with a few hundred pornographic images and the DA moved to have his house seized and liquidated in order to fund future crimefighting endeavors. The reasoning? The crime would've been impossible to facilitate without the house therefore the house was necessary in the facilitation of the crime.  

So the guy gets 10 years in prison and his wife gets kicked out of the house and is living in governmental housing so that the State can have it's way with their property.  

And even though that sets a nasty precedent, no one will fight it because, you know, child porn."
iama,"Well living in the UK there aren't really many ""camp""  facilities over here.

I was stuck in a rut of not actually knowing what I wanted to do with my life, swapping between dead-end jobs due to the fact I left college early without qualifications (personal reasons although I've usually always been a academically driven person). One day my granddad mentioned that one of his work colleagues had a daughter that had just been on a program called Camp America; I looked into it,  decided on a whim that I would do it.  
"
worldnews,"Actually China will keep their ""non-interference"" doctrine alive, but quietly suggesting Russia back down.  Because any conflict in Eastern Europe is likely to result in gas supplies being cut off to Western Europe and the EU.  The EU is a major market for China.  If war erupts, fuel prices world wide are going to rise and that hurts China.  I believe that China now owns or leases 5 - 10% of the Farmland in Ukraine to help feed China.  

So while China won't officially say anything, they know it's in their best interest ultimately for Russia to backdown and the situation not to get any worse.  "
todayilearned,"There's a really well done debate on intelligence squared regarding genetically engineered children, which falls into this idea of eugenics. A large issue is right now we don't have an exact understanding about how trying to ""perfect"" a person would really turn out and subject others to that sort of experimentation, whether it be through natural conception or manually altering the genes is ethical. The argument that we should intentionally allow others to suffer for the possibility of a better future without their consent is really fucked up btw. "

My mom had breast cancer in 2012 and told me about how she felt like she wasn't allowed to be pissed off about it. She couldn't understand her friends who were so positive about cancer and saw it as some kind of learning experience. I immediately thought of your book and sent her a copy.

She loved it and said it made her feel a lot better about how she was feeling. I know she's recommended it to a few people since then as well. 

I really enjoy all your books and hope to read the new one soon. Thanks again!"

worldnews,"[The singularity is coming.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) but it is not a threat.  

People seem to forget that biology keeps humanity going, but a computer doesn't have physical reproductive capabilities outside of humans creating them.  

Computers can already out think us in a number of ways.  The cellphone in your pocket can do things in seconds that would take your brain a lifetime to complete.  

Learned computing intelligence is just barely coming into being, and I can only imagine of the things that will be discovered when we can push computer past what the human brain is capable of. 

Think about it, humans share 99.4% DNA with the closest ape relative, and look at the incredible insights and understanding that gives us!  

If we can create an intelligence that has another half of a percentage point or more than what the human brain is limited to, our understanding of the universe around us will expand in ways we cannot yet imagine. "
science,"Right, but the issue isn't just that the garbage is being overloaded, but that the garbage is accumulating in the apartment in the first place.

To continue the metaphor, imagine an apartment, and understand that garbage will generate. Placing the garbage in the trash bin is how that garbage gets cleaned up. If you mess up the trash bin (make it smaller, say), you will see an accumulation of that trash, but preventing the trash from getting to the trash bin in the first place may not be a solution to the problem.

I'm basing this on Trojanowski's reviews, and what I'm seeing in the accumulation patterns of APP and TDP-43 overexpression experiments. "
todayilearned,"Care to point out where I said that? You can't, BECAUSE I NEVER SAID THAT! Did you read anything I said? Or did you just see the word ""patriarchy"" and shut your brain off?

I'm assuming you've come up with that because you have no idea what patriarchy means. And you think it means something like ""Men purposefully oppressing women"" Which of course is stupid and no one would believe it if that's what it meant.

What ""patriarchy"" actually means is a system where society, both men and women, treat people differently based on their gender, where both male and female managers are going to treat men favorably. And that's what the science indicates.

iama,"Every once in a while these places get news coverage, usually when a kid dies in one of them (which is sadly not that uncommon). But, as you noted, in general this isn't an issue most people are aware of. I think that part of the reason that there hasn't been much news coverage and no large pubic outcry is because the kids that get sent to these programs often don't talk about their experiences for years if ever. It's kind of like the Catholic priest abuse scandal - it was happening for decades before enough people came forward to get attention on the issue. 

I hope that this film contributes to a groundswell of people speaking out about their experiences in the programs so that this issue can get the attention it needs. "
science,"One data point predicts nothing at all. However we've found countless planets, countless star systems and countless evidence of organic molecules existing not from Earth but from somewhere else. And this water/dust thing is just another drop in the bucket. We know water is an essential condition for life as we know it and if it can exist on Earth in it's billions of forms that mostly if not all depend on water, then I'd be willing to say the evidence is pretty strong. Plus life is natural, just like everything else in the universe, so just like planets, suns etc, they may be complex but it doesn't make them unique in it's location."

Maybe you should consider the fact that Kiev is bombing civilians all over Eastern Ukraine...no, of course, the only innocents that count are the ones that vote for Western-backed leaders. "
science,"So you're a nurse of some sort, and basing that opinion on personal observation? How well would you say that you are able to guess what a ""healthy"" body fat percentage is, without testing? 

I don't mean that to sound hostile or anything. It's just, there is a very real trend in the US towards accepting higher and higher body fat levels as healthy. Anymore people consider perfectly normal body fat as too skinny. So I'm just highly skeptical of any anecdotes that try and justify a very real weight problem. 

Diseases and complications related to excess fat aren't exactly a statistic that's getting lower. "
science,"Exactly.

Regarding your points, you can even see basketball players in their old age hobble around because their knees are pretty much shot. Same goes for NFL players.

And while athletes watch what they eat during their prime, it's not uncommon to see athletes let themselves go after they retire. Or get addicted to pain killers because of the chronic pain. Or get head injuries like a concussion that forces them into retirement (i.e. Marc Savard, Chris Pronger) or potentially contributes to suicide.

On top of that, if I recall correctly, a Harvard study showed that NFL/CFL players have a lower LE than the general population."

Many companies will set up operations with undercovers who get crooked contractors out- faking damages, padding invoices, etc. These guys get handcuffed and hauled to jail.

Nobody's done the research and I'm appalled this possibility isn't mentioned in this article."
worldnews,"This is due to a culture view of women as property. Whether it is caused by Islam or not is irrelevant, as the true power of it is in the cultural hegemony of the region. The importance of changing this is not just feminist, but humanist. If we believe that all humans , we in a most basic sense believe that no person should be thought of as property, that the word of all is equal (speaking prior to evidence*), and that we should respect the freedom of individuals to choose how they represent their own body.

If that chosen representation involves wearing body coverings, so be it. That being said, it is impossible to argue that freedom of choice in that regard is possible given cultural expectation to wear coverings. Therefore we should decry all cultural expectations of physical representation both for men and women.

Of course, humanism is only one opinion. It is my opinion, and I believe it is factually more successful in achieving happiness, therefore I will argue for it."

science,"&gt; No big surprise. We need to focus on what to do next. Perhaps expand use of solar. Nuclear energy. Reduce coal use. If prices on our Chinese goods increase it will be a good thing.

Choice of energy supply alone is not the only thing causing pollution. Mismanagement and negligence with conventional technology is the main perpetrator. For example, in North America, before disposing of chemicals you have to treat them. In China, often times, they just pour them out the back without any treament whatsoever.

And the problem is a lot of Communist members own these businesses causing the pollution, so they don't want to press any environmental issues."

I'll probably give that a read, in all seriousness.

Also, I love my idea too! Mostly because if enough regular people, or just a couple of diplomats, go over there and get the wrong idea, then there may be a grassroots (or government-initiated) effort based on the idea that we have to ""free"" the North Koreans.

iama,"&gt;You can believe in the right to bear arms and also believe in gun control.

Not really. The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right (stemming from proerpty rights and self-defense/right to life rights). Any type of control or restriction on that by the State is an infringement against that right. Now, if you mean the free market can regulate, then I agree. In a truly free market society, businessess would be within their rights to deny sale to anyone for any reason.

And think of it this way: most people don't bat an eye at government having guns/arms, yet the State is the biggest mass murderer and biggest criminal in all of mankind's history. I wouldn't exactly call the State ""sane"" or ""careful"". "

For stop barking, you need to make a LOUD noise or do something that stops them barking. AS SOON AS they stop barking, say ""Yes, good boy/girl"" or waterer your good command is and reward them for it. Then you increase the duration of non-barking to giving them praise and rewards as soon as you get them to stop barking. This will teach them not to just stop barking in that moment.

- — Saudi Arabia formally designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization Friday, putting it on the same footing under Saudi law as al Qaida and shaking what until recent months had been considered one of the Muslim worlds most established mainstream organizations.



- The U.S. State Department said it did not share Saudi Arabias view that the Brotherhood was a terrorist organization.



- Saudi Arabia has long been hostile toward the Brotherhood, whose doctrine opposes the kingdoms dynastic rule.



- Saudi Arabia previously has spoken out against Saudi fighters going to Syria.



- But it was likely to affect not just the way Saudi Arabia deals with Brotherhood members in its own country, but how it works with Brotherhood-affiliated organizations around the world.

I think this is a good argument for the Russian's to impose a no fly zone over the Ukraine, it's not reasonable to expect rebels to accomplish this accurately especially when commercial operators refuse to follow obvious and basic precautions in this circumstance. There is a particularly dark possibility which is that the Ukrainians have been deliberately shadowing civilian aircraft..."
iama,"For the sake of argument, Not all individuals in society will take responsibility and they never will. 

Right now we can force some consequences on them after they didn't took responsibility but mostly after it's too late. How do you want to fix that without touching the right to bear arms? 

Perhaps there should be some gradation in the right to bear arms? People should be able to lose the right to bear arms in more cases. And there should be more means in controlling how firearms spread in the society.

Of course that means giving up more control of firearm distribution to the government. And seeing how the most vocal American gun owners own guns to protect themselves from the government they will most likely to refuse to accept any change on that. 

So in the end nothing will have changed.

iama,"I'll go and be curious one more time. You mentioned international worshops, so I wondered about language barrier. Say I wanted to join (then again I'm not entirely sure this is for my age grioup) Poland being financial way more available than London for me, but then again I can't do Polish too much.

So what language are these gonna be in? I'd understand that if target group is 13-16 years, it'd make more sense for workshops to be in language of given country, but is there a way they could be bi-lingual (or even multi-lingual really)?"

this is huge much like pissing in the ocean makes a big difference, its nothing but platitudes. "

It is a dysfunction of your Adrenal gland which leads to chronic inflammation.  Many people have beat it but you can't take some doctor prescribed pill and just expect it to go away.  You have to attack it from many different angles including diet, supplements and lifestyle changes.  Relief is possible, but don't expect to go to a medical doctor and hear the real story.  They barely even consider it an illness.  "

For the most part, you can make fun of Christianity a little more than you can some of the other major religions, and if you find the right congretation, none of them really take it seriously so I'd fit right in.

Also, I do family stuff on all the Christian holidays like Christmas and Easter, since it's a family tradition, so I wouldn't have to adjust my schedule or pull my kids out of school for a non-statutory holiday (other than Luke Skywalker Day, but that's a given)."

iama,"You can't know if you are harming your animal partner. Legally your partner cannot consent. We don't let animals sign contracts or drive or vote. We treat tame animals as dependents, not as equals. But it's not about that they are animals. 

If you were really attracted to retarded people, or little kids, or people in comas, or psychotic people who are hallucinating, it would be a similar situation. You have an unfair advantage, and your partners can't communicate or set boundaries like a competent adult person does. 

Human beings who can communicate in the same language are still raped and abused, frequently because of misunderstandings. It's fundamentally unethical to indulge in sexual desires with actual live animals. Doesn't matter that it feels great, you need to think of protecting and honoring the rights of someone other than yourself. It is not moral to take sexual advantage of someone who can't consent. "
science,"I don't think younger people are necessarily getting more divorces because of the age they get married.  I tend to think it's because 1) We're more selfish as a society which means less likely to stick to our vows when things get rough; and 2) Divorce is easier (process-wise, 'no fault,' etc.) and more socially acceptable than it used to be.

So, yeah... We hopefully get wiser as we age and mature, but it can also be more time on our own to grow more selfish. Selfishness is a huge marriage killer."
worldnews,"you should rethink that, that is a bad analogy. And distinctions are made between the severity of acts all the time. Should someone who hits someone get in the same amount of trouble as someone who kills someone? they both have in common that one person hurt the other, but the difference in severity is so great that it doesn't make sense to call it the same thing.

iama,"Hey man, I'm CEO at WhiteMoon Dreams, and I'm sure you and I would have met during the Emergent/WDI days :) 

We used Early Access for everything really. Valve suggested to us that we use it to really get player feedback to shape the game and that's exactly what we did. Despite all the controversy around Early Access, Valve's intent for it has always been that developers use it to get feedback around the game when it is playable enough. We did this and it has increased the quality of the game 200%, as well as helped build an incredible community. 

So, we used it to get player feedback on balance issues, polish, thoughts on potential new features and that has grown into the concept that we may actually open up the roadmap for the game to players so they can help us grow the game in the direction they want. 

BTW, hit me up offline at jayk@whitemoondreams.com and let's chat about your group! "
science,"Hey there, first year pharmacy student here. I've just spent the last month learning all about penicillins, and this article claims that they found another type of penicillin that is for viruses. I know that the way penicillins work is the beta lactam ring that breaks apart bacterial cell walls. This article seems misleading, claiming that this is another penicillin, especially since the ""broad spectrum"" is limited to influenza (while yes, there are many types of influenza). I suppose I can see the relation but again, I find it misleading since it probably isn't the same structure as penicillin at all. Are all of those drugs you named only for HIV?"
worldnews,"a sam would use primary (or search radar) to find azimuth, range, and altitude.

It'd be pointless to have a sam system that tracked solely on transponders, as military jets would just turn off their squawks.

This said I haven't seen a SAM radar scope, but I've seen a number of different types of air defense and air traffic scopes so I'm making assumptions based on that."

It's not a coincidence humans have found value in gold, other civilizations out there would value gold all the same.

Hi, what tests do you run? The monospot gives a fair number of false positive and negative results whereas the antibody testing is more accurate. 

It would be interesting to know how many patients are being diagnosed as having ""EBV mono"" without a blood test in which case it could be due to one of several other agents (although EBV is by far the most common cause). 

The above factors likely explain the reports of 'multiple' occurrences of EBV-associated mononucleosis we are getting in this AMA (in other words, for the same person one mono caused by e.g. CMV [misdiagnosed as EBV], then another case in the same person caused by EBV). "
science,"I currently work in a lab doing research into the genetics of autism and schizophrenia. One of the senior members of our lab has made the assertion that the observed rate of autism is 2-3 x higher in populations such as silicone valley. Their explanation for this is that disorders such as ASD may imply a selective advantage within our society in certain roles that we attempt to fulfill. Such as focusing on very specific tasks like programming as in silicone valley.

Do you think the idea that the increased incidence of ASD (besides being from a changing definition of what is classified as ASD) could come from selective pressure within our society?"
iama,"Hey mark!, first of all, though i'm sure it's a given, i'm a huge fan of sherlock. I was curious about the sherlock character. After having been introduced to Dr. Watson he seemed to grow and be more adept at forming and maintaining social relationships. After the fall he seemed to unravel and sink deeper into his own mind. I have two questions.

1: Will the progression of the series show Sherlock further devolving into his former isolated self?

2: Did you have a chance to sit down with Derren Brown (just realizing that would be a great title for a talk show) and did he blow your mind? "
science,"FWIW, I agree with Dr. Shepherd's response. As for ""is quantum mechanics involved"" -- that is way outside my area of expertise, but I don't know that you need to go all the way to the quantum level to observe weird, seemingly random events affecting consciousness. 

When you start talking about the level of the synapse, you're getting into territory where very small numbers of molecules interacting with each other are leading to a change in brain activity and connectivity. I went to a talk by Dr. Ken Kosik from UC Santa Barbara a while back that described how certain micro-RNA molecules are present at individual synapses at very low numbers -- 0, 1, maybe 2 molecules per synapse. This introduces a degree of randomness into how each synapse will respond to activation, depending on whether or not the micro-RNA is there to affect local protein synthesis. Dr. Kosik referred to this as the ""stochastic availability of neural machinery to respond to the contingency of synaptic firing."" "
iama,"well, it works better the earlier you start it, but apparently there is no 'too late' to at least see some improvement. Apparently some people start in their 40s or 50s (can't even imagine dealing with this for that long.) 

For me, it's covered by medical (also, I'm in Canada, which ROCKS.) so no real expense. The bottle in the picture was $45, though. So not huge. 

Also, it's not every day-injections are typically every 3 weeks, intramuscular. I do it every week subcutaneously because it allows me to self-inject, and because I don't end up limping for 3 days if I accidentally clench while the needle's in the muscle. "

Why did you decide to set Fallout in the future of a '50s sci-fi world instead of the future of the real world? As much as I enjoy Fallout, I feel like the '50s pulp sci-fi content sometimes works against the player's ability to empathize and relate to a given character or subplot.

Where do you see the future of the Fallout universe going? Do nation-states eventually reconstitute themselves in some sort of parodical semblance of the old world nation-states, and then nuke each other again?

Lastly, how do you see the current state of the RPG genre? It seems like, with the exception of a couple of big name series, the genre is on a downward slide. Then again, it also seems the genre has won gaming, because almost every other genre incorporates RPG elements. Almost every game these days incorporates the basic concepts of HP, (E)XP, leveling up, etc. Where is the RPG at, and where is it going?"

She is aware she is confused and that something is wrong, and it upsets her a lot. 

She is in the advanced stages of terminal cancer. It started as pancreatic, and it's metastasized to ten other organs in her body. She has not taken chemo in several months due to complications.

1. From early on many of the characters had the same name as the actors who played them (Sarah, Lucy, Cory, 'Phil' Collins etc.). Was that the choice of the actors, pure coincidence, or just lazin-...economical use of writing time? 

2. How canon is the DLI movie? My own theory is that, if it's canon at all, it occurs after season 8 but before 9, based solely on the fact that Sam and Cyrus seem to be rolling together in the movie (it seemed a new thing in the episodes); Ricky has no MJ license (I can think of a million ways he could have lost it though); and Bubs does not have his bus (I can think of a million ways Ricky could have fucked that up for Bubs too).

Keep in mind, these are the same people that claimed we went to Iraq for their ""oil"", despite evidence to the contrary. Now that that bullshit was soundly debunked, you barely hear that accusation anymore. Except for when they tried to switch it up to ""minerals"" instead of ""oil"".

science,"I remember seeing this story a few weeks ago. The concept is to put the organs on ice (literally and figuratively) for up to approx. 60 minutes. To achieve that, they replace the blood in the body with a cold saline solution. Like the steaks in your freezer, human tissue doesn't decompose when it's cold. 

The practical application is to expand the time window of life-saving surgeries. It might take a person 4 minutes to bleed out vs. 60 minutes their body can be held in suspense. Once complete, saline solution is replaced with blood, and the person is resuscitated."

The way we, as humans, as a species, raise our children is so radically different than it was even a single generation ago. Could there be consequences we are only now seeing?

Could we literally be affecting our species on an evolutionary scale of thousands of years? For better or worse? 

I think our species has advance so far that we are toying with forces we don't understand. And we may not even be aware that we are doing so. This may sound crazy, but just think of the technology we have. Think of what is normal today, right now, that was unthinkable 100 years ago. What was magic 200 years ago. What was divine intervention 1000 years ago.

And since the economy of Jordan has hit a wall recently, many schools don't have proper classrooms or resources to teach the children properly, not to mention around 600 students in highschool are illiterate, and turned in their final exam papers empty. 

What we noticed really happens, is that the kids have hidden talents. They have great potential, but are rarely ever given the chance to unleash it and do projects themselves outside the boring school curriculum that even misses out on properly teaching evolution to 10th graders.

We think it sounds great and we hope you do to.  From a technical standpoint, our audio performance will be uniform throughout its full range and it will have similar levels of output in terms of power and frequency range to competing products.  But because there is no surface distortion we think it will sound better.

worldnews,"Did you really say Yanukovych ""voluntarily abandoned his position""? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAA

and did you really attempt to deny Yatsenyuk is not Jewish? gtfoh.

And yes, the West (primarily the US) pushed a coup in the Ukraine.  And Yatensyuk was placed into that position prior to any elections being held. The people of the Ukraine have never voted for that scum to represent him, yet that scum is representing the people of the Ukraine.

Yatsensuk was also never offered the presidency, not that position offered matters anyway as he was overwhelmingly rejected by the people of the Ukraine but they now find their nation being prostrated to the EU and the World Back by this unelected scumbag."

There's plenty of interesting things you can find on the internet, but my best recommendation would be the youtube channel [Vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce)

science,"The issue many people have with accepting modern science is forming the science around their beliefs. 

This is done because people have an absolute belief in god, they believe god exists because that is what they have been told their entire lives. Normally someone from an objective perspective would look at how massive the universe is and understand why such things are possible. A person that has been subjected to religion is likely to look at the universe, acknowledge how big it is and ultimately believe that only a deity is capable of such things. Which isn't necessarily a bad position to hold, but it can mislead you on other topics.

No doubt there's going to be a period where lots of lower/middle class people fall off their life style because their value contribution has been made almost zero by robots (such as drivers vs automated cars). These people will suffer, but the maintenance, research and creation of new tech is going to continue, and if more parts of industry/services are going to be replaced with robots and computers, more computer related jobs will start to emerge. With robotic production, more goods and services will become available for cheaper, and so you will indeed work less over the long run, but maintain a similar lifestyle. "

Malaysia is a pretty small country and has a substantial non-Malay, non-Muslim minority (Chinese Buddhists and Indian Hindus); in terms of Muslim population it is only 20th in the world. 

All three countries you mention have substantially larger Muslim populations; even India, where Muslims are a small percentage (14%) of the overall population has *ten times* as many Muslims than Malaysia does. Even China has more Muslims than Malaysia.

Malaysia is also pretty liberal and modern as Muslim countries go. In what way do you see it as ""more"" Muslim? "
science,"Yeah, I have a Subaru running on E85 that makes 450hp. On E10 I can't run nearly as high of boost pressure on the turbo. So even though the energy density of E85 is a lot lower than that of E10, the greatly increased pressures in the cylinder mean I make more power. I also happen to get poor gas mileage as a result because running E85 means I also can increase the fuel flow rates into the cylinders(higher pressure air means greater mass of air so I need a greater mass of fuel to burn at stoichiometric conditions). For reference, I get about 16mpg on a 4 cyl turbo Subaru. I did better with my 89 Jeep Cherokee that was as aerodynamic as a brick on a 6 cylinder engine. Hell, most modern V8 cars that make around the same amount of power as I do get better gas mileage. And it is because they run on E10 fuels. "

iama,"Hi Barbara, I just finished a course on the sociology of work, and I want to ask you something on the newly emerging work norms in the global North: employers are moving away from the standard employment relationship towards more flexible, insecure, and precarious forms of work, which I think is effectively reflected in chapter 8 of *Bait and Switch*. Do you see this shift as something progressive or potentially liberating for workers, or are these emerging norms just another form of worker exploitation?"
askreddit,"This reminds me of a time I was at public restroom and people were queueing for the cubicles. There was a guy ahead of me but we were standing in a line facing the cubicles, so he was to the left of me. A cubicle came free and he went into it, I scanned the other cubicles waiting for someone to exit and as I scanned back I noticed a lump and trail leading to the door the guy had gone into. I looked up and caught the eye of the attendant who had evidently just looked up from the same pile. The guy was obviously desperate for the toilet but had shit himself. 

So I guess the answer is because people are usually desperate to go and any prior  mess takes too long to clean up so they end up adding to it. "

I'm pro choice myself and my personal definition of when it's a baby is when it can survive outside of the womb. Preemies are babies by my definition. But there is no doubt in my mind that abortions are a choice that should be determined by an individual, not anyone else. "

Yet only 56% of people polled in the most liberal of Muslim countries identified in this study (Tunisia, apparently) thought that women should have the basic right to dress themselves, and yet Western ""intellectuals"" for the most part seem to come up with nothing but excuses even for this sort of basic injustice."

As far as general advice goes, if you're from America then there won't be a huge culture difference. The biggest thing I can think of is that we don't really tip here; maybe 10% on a meal, but never for bar service.

iama,"My experience with places that serve these kinds of drinks is that they'll probably be annoyed -- not appreciative -- that you would waste their time trying to describe the drink because you didn't like the name. 

Offensive drink names are part of the culture of these novelty drinks. You're not having a very sophisticated evening if you're out pounding Irish car bombs and red-headed sluts. 

Either embrace the trashiness or don't, but it's pretty silly to attempt to be culturally sensitive given the setting of debauchery that generally accompanies them.

The **Arab** countries attacked Israel when the UN partitioned the land, not the Palestinians.

I'd rather think it was an act of unbelievable restraint that Israel didn't send its forces into Cairo and annihilate the city for their attack. It's an area that Israel took in a defensive war. Israel was kind enough to allow it to be administered - then Hamas took over and starts throwing rockets and bombs at Israel.

Israel is stronger. It has bigger weapons, a better military, and a mandate to protect its people. Shit, we took our mandate to protect our people all the way to Iraq and Afghanistan and destroyed their countries, but Israel isn't allowed to deal with Gaza by settling it? Okay, why don't they just go with the old American tactic and just carpet bomb anywhere that insurgents are thought to be holed up? Israel is showing considerable restraint against a region that is launching rockets at its people."

The 5th amendment goes a little something like this: “Nor shall any person … be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.”

Any person, you see, not any citizen so that would (or should, when read) include little old me.

I say this because in the 14th amendment itself it clearly differentiates between person and citizen; so the writers clearly felt there was a reason to differentiate between persons and citizens at different points and therefore the 5th amendment should be read to include anyone within it's jurisdiction, citizen or otherwise.

Like I said, I'm not an expert on US Law and the US Constitution. I studied British Law, that's just how I read it.

When TV hosts from the 70s started being found guilty of similar crimes, we all agreed that it was the culture of television production in the 70s, that said that these stars were untouchable and could do what they wanted, that was a contributing factor.


When Priests were being found guilty of raping boys, we all agreed that it was the culture within the church that played a big part.


Why then is it unreasonable to say that it was the cultural upbringing of these men that played a part in why they committed these crimes, when so much evidence show it to be the case. We are all a product of our environments.

todayilearned,"Galileo wasn't imprisoned just for his ideas. He was given permission by Pope Urban VIII (a friend of his) to write a book debating heliocentrism with both viewpoints supported. He chose to name the man who supported geocentrism Simplicio after a classical philosopher, Simplicius. Unfortunately, the name Simplicio sounded as bad in Italian as it would in English and people thought Galileo was calling the Pope a simpleton. Insulting the Pope, even if it was unintentional, coupled with his unorthodox views is what got him put under house arrest. Clearly this wasn't close to a fair outcome under today's standards, but it's probably better than he would have gotten in many other places in Europe at the time."

International law as well as the opinion of the international community is UNANIMOUS that Palestine including East Jeruselem is occupied and Israel's aggressive settling of Palestinian land at gunpoint is the primary cause of the conflict.

This law is an Israeli right wingers wet dream, the U.S. declares all of Palestine to be Israel sans the Palestinians.  What a joke."

It is scary.  Do a google search on the new plan by Obama to have the FCC monitor news rooms.   You will find that none of the mainstream media comes up in the search, at least mine.

If I do happen to remember it later, I think ""eh, I'll just grab it tomorrow when I get home from work"". 

It isn't like I have one of those nightmare hoarder cars filled with junk or anything. Literally the only thing in my SUV is that blanket, neatly folded and an emergency car kit on top of it.

Good news is when we start camping again, it'll be there. "
todayilearned,"Yeah but you are wrong. That fake sugar shit tastes god awful and will probably end up giving you cancer. All the liquor stores in California have a well-hidden sign somewhere that's basically like a surgeon general warning on cigarettes but for diet soda and anything containing that terrible chemical. They almost made the warnings have to be right on the bottle but coke/pepsi's lobbying power is stronk.

Totally reasonable for regular coke to taste nasty though, it has processed sugar in it now, not much better. "
iama,"Kind of answered here: [–]RealJeffBridges[S] 7 points 44 minutes ago

That is true! And the costumer for The Big Lebwoski (and also True Grit and many of the Coen brothers films) came over to my house, and went through my closet, and there are quite a few articles of clothing that they used for The Dude from my closet. The baseball shirt with the famous Japanese baseball player on it I stole from my brother Beau, that is in the movie. And there might be some other ones, but nothing is coming to mind, I would have to look at the movie and see.

askreddit,"The situation I was referring to was at my last job in an office, there was only one restroom and if you took longer then 5 minutes someone would definitely knock on the door. I sometimes spent more time wiping down the seat and sink area more than I would using the toilet. I pretty much knew who was making the mess but the next person would have definitely blamed me and the way people were in that office it would spread around pretty quickly. Drove me crazy. In a public bathroom I would still try to clean a bit but would careless what the next person would think. "
iama,"Overall, it's probably 65% planned and 35% unplanned depending how dynamic a market you're working in. On the strip, you're dealing with longer timelines to get people in the door (e.g., you're planning a big concert that's going to take place in 9 months) so it's a little less reactionary vs. a local's market like a Stations casino or some smaller market where you have lots of competitors and people who come very, very frequently which causes business to be very volatile. But definitely, in every market I've worked in, the first thing you do in the morning is look at the previous day's performance and do a lot of talking and looking at reports to figure out if you're on the right track or if you need to change directions.


Like I said, feel free to PM me if something is personal. "
worldnews,"I appreciate that you answered honestly. Whenever I pin someone on it, and ask what actions Obama could take, they say be more aggressive. When I ask if that means military, they say no no, of course not. Then the whole thing goes back to Obama being perceived as weak, and there's no more arguing because their minds are made up.

You appear to be actually suggesting a pretty heavy military presence. I personally think that's rather dangerous, it would be viewed as hypocritical and provocative by most of the world. We have to be ready for anything, but I don't think that kind of muscle is going to go over well.

But thank you for being one of the few the answer this question, I so rarely see or hear it. "
askreddit,A really scary book I've just read is The Eaters Of The Dead. The movie The Thirteenth Warrior is loosely based on it. The book is a journal/diary of a scholar way back in like the twelfth century that lives among the Vikings. Somewhere which I believe is Newfoundland They have to fight a tribe of some half humans which I believe today we would call Bigfoot. It's incomplete due to part of it being lost somewhere in time so it ends rather abruptly. But it is a good look at life among the Vikings and how brave they were in dealing with the supernatural.

&gt;If you mean:

- the correct distance from their parent star so that any water that may be present is liquid rather than gas/ice.

- the correct size as to potentially allow an atmosphere to form.

Going by those 2 factors, then yes, there are, and we have an estimated 8.8 billion of these type of planets in our galaxy alone.

worldnews,"I think misogyny is a rather cruddy thing, and I am no particular fan of burqas myself. However, it is not up to one group to unilaterally levy a cultural change on those voluntarily adopting a tradition, and so I am against spiteful intentions like cultural bans in the guise of morality- burqas, speaking Spanish in the southern US, wearing jeans in Saudi Arabia.

Now, a culture certainly can demonstrate and educate others in its own moral values; however, to assume that any of the involved cultures has a perfect morality (or even a popular morality) is more of a stretch than is comfortable.

The point here is that burqas themselves are not hateful to others, but banning them is, and claiming the opposite is fraudulent."

science,"Corn is now roughly 1/3 the price it was 2 years ago ($8-$2.90). Wheat has dropped from $8/bu to $5 a bushel. Beans are now at $9.80/bu when they were at $15 last year. All ag commodity prices have fallen over the past couple years. That ""government initiative"" is called CRP, the Conservation Reserve Program. If the landowner applies and is accepted into the program the land sits idle and the landowner receives payment, usually less than $50/acre. When we had cutbacks in CRP acres more corn was planted because we (the US) were flirting with marginal stocks of corn. By the time of the 2012 harvest the US was down to just 2-3 weeks of use supply. Between feed, ethanol, exports and general industry consumption the US uses 230 MILLION bushels of corn per week. In my area, no crop for 2015 is penciling in for a profit at average yields. "

science,"I'd always heard that corn subsidies were more of a depression era thing, and the problem only arose when we switched from a system of corn insurance, where we loaned money to farmers based on their crop. If prices were higher than normal, farmers would pay back the loan and make money from selling the crop. If prices were low, the government kept the crop and the farmer kept the money. Then if prices went up, the government sold their collected corn. This kept prices stable and helped keep farmers in business by removing a great deal of risk and uncertainty. The problem came when we switched from this system to simply paying farmers the difference in price between the market value and whatever we say it should be. This gives farmers an incentive to over produce, since they can always get money from the government to offset any decrease in price from an increase in supply, which wasn't true under the previous system. I got most of this from reading The Omnivore's Dilemma."

Or you store the date/time in UTC which has no daylight switch, then you can just map the date/time back to the correct CDT or CST with ease when you display the time because the date and time of the daylight savings switch is known.

If the hospital's system doesn't record the timezone or store in UTC, then you would have a situation where the second baby appears to be born first.  Some systems probably do work this way.    Daylight savings is an annoyance with software."

Also, say you want to learn CNC? Around here at least, you still need to learn manual machining before they'll let you at the CNC machines, so that you don't try to tell it to do anything too flagrantly stupid (still doesn't stop some people &gt;.&lt; ), and so you can properly evaluate the parts it's making.

And even if you converted the (rather cool) [RoboPlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPg1ZMiC9pA) to drive itself and had a whole fleet of them, you'd still want an operator or two around in case one of them encountered something unexpected and didn't know how to deal with it."

worldnews,"The buk missile system are self propelled missiles, so they will leave a trail and the time that the picture was posted and the time the flight was reported to be shot down matches up pretty well. The events shown on the live map are taken from blogs, personal twitter accounts and official news. So whether the picture is real or fake is for you to decide. The radar that the system uses is pretty primitive so if the rebels were using it to shoot down military planes they could easily mistake the commercial flight for a military plane. The only difference is the speed at which the planes would be traveling.

The point I was trying to make is that natural selection is, statistically, a far more probable explanation for a given trait than genetic drift, not that drift doesn't actually occur. You're right that I'm basing my argument off a simplified model, but over the course of our species' history, migration and gene flow between populations appears to have been the norm so I don't think it's totally invalid.

I've grown up with anything BBC - I can't get enough of it. But anything shown here is dribble. That said - Please still come to Australia. We're not all dribble and pishposh."
science,"Does  your work involve the causes, effects and consequences of brain aneurysms? I had sub arachnoid hemorrhage a little over a year ago which was coiled after about 7 days of thinking it was a heavy migraine. Miraculously, I didn't have a stroke and my motor skills are pretty fine, except for mild vertigo and less sense of balance. My questions are in regards to how to bounce back from the consequences and side effects that I am suffering through... Depression, anxiety, irritability, inattentiveness and working memory deficiencies. What can I do to improve my elasticity? What can I do to remove these blocks that I feel are holding me back from living a fuller life, more in line with how I was living prior to this aneurysm. Lastly, what can I do to prevent another one, if anything?"
askreddit,"As a married woman, I get that when we give hints and clues we are often times a bit too subtle, but at one point I was waking my husband up every other morning after his alarm played on his phone and initiating sex. I finally confided in him that his alarm on his phone was making me horny. (Some random song he likes that he uses with his regular alarm to wake up that makes me reminisce of the time when we were young with no worries and responsibilities.)

After a couple days I realize the song no longer plays and it's just the regular alarm. When I asked him about it, he thought THAT was what was making me horny... a blaring alarm going ERRR ERRR ERRR ERRR at 6 every morning."

todayilearned," Never mind the fact that to someone critically thinking about trying heroin / picking up a heroin habit (if such a person even exists), the risk of getting a disease from it probably weighs almost none on their decision. The risk can be completely removed by just using clean needles you buy on your own. So heroin when done properly, even without needle exchange programs is perfectly safe from diseases. So the perception that heroin use can be free from risk of disease already exists today. Maybe heroin use levels are high because of it, but they won't go any higher because of a 'perception of safe use in the future that could arise from free needle exchange programs' because we're there already. The free clean needles would have no effect on rational people just starting out, they're for the people caught in the depths of a heroin binge, living on the streets, no longer thinking rationally, controlled 100% by their addiction."
todayilearned,"Those ships resemble the stuff that many nations in the area came up with. Galley is the term for that kind of ship I believe. Uses rudimentary sails as well as rowers. Fairly long, 25 meters fair? 

Those ships would NEVER be brought out to sea. They're going to stay near the coasts. Not only could they not hold the supplies needed for a voyage, they'd never survive the trip to begin with. 

And yeah, they didn't have a great history of seafaring. For a coastal people they didn't travel all that far. 

And Occam's razor applies everywhere. All it says is the simplest answer is typically the right one. This is usually true. Don't delude yourself, the simple fact that there isn't any records of this travel should be enough. NOTHING points to it being true besides this really minor piece of evidence. If that's not a stretch, I don't know what is. "
askreddit,"As someone who lives in Philadelphia, I must say that I personally never feel safe in this situation.

Sure, 95% of people out there will not pull a gun on you upon hopping in the car or run away with your phone, but the danger/inconvenience that comes with that 5% simply doesn't make it worth it. Besides, I have horrible luck in general.

worldnews,"Well yeah, there is corruption and sometimes outsourcing doesn't make sense. I think the problem that you are describing is a symptom of big government. Our republic is inefficient by design and thus never meant to be grown to the size that it is today. A beaurocracy of this size with this amount of free money and power is going to reflect the nature of the people that run it (corrupt and power hungry, maintaining power through special interest). So, like usual, the truth is gray. Republicans AND democrats are guilty of lining the pockets of their buddies by outsourcing."

Him: ""Damn gurl thas messed up!  Id treat you gud, gurl, like take you out to eat or some shit.""  

Her: ""Want to meet up?""  

The source of my impression is that I have an ex who left me for ""always"" ""playing"" on my PC, where ""always"" was an hour or two per day, and ""playing"" was homework for a programming class.  Since then, I've heard the story countless times from people with significant others who want non-stop undivided attention. People in a relationship only for entertainment, who don't get it, seldom move on to something stable."

It could also be due to a genetic condition in either of them or both or a difference in nutrition in the womb (a number of factors can cause intrauterine growth retardation including poor blood supply via the placenta).

askreddit,"My husband uses one occasionally. He has compartment syndrome in his legs (one failed surgery; made that leg worse) and using a cane takes the pressure off each leg. He switches which leg he uses it on, depending on which is hurting worse at the time. 

Cons, I can tell you, are remembering to bring it in with you in stores.. and then remembering to take it out of the buggy and put it back in the car. Makes it more difficult to carry our son and use a cane. People (kids) like to play with your cane.

Pros, helps his leg, gets to carry around a cool lookin' cane (his has a hawk on top where your hand is), could hide a sword in it if he wanted to?!? (illegally)."
iama,"Very often. About 60-70% of the cases referred over to us end up being paid in full. Now, this doesn't mean that ALL of those were completely legit. Maybe we couldn't prove it. Maybe a state law forced the company to pay the claim. Or the adjuster accidentally cut the check (it happens!). I'd guess that once you filter those out, about 40% of the claims referred to me are not fraudulent at all; it's just a misunderstanding or a wrong-place-wrong-time deal.

Sometimes it feels good when I can actually help a person prove their legitimate claim. Some people just aren't that articulate or they don't appear to be very trustworthy, but they are good honest people. You know the type.

The most notable non-fraud case that I can think of is unfortunately too unique - it would be too easy to find out who I was. So I can't post it, which just kills me because it's a great story.

iama,"As a husband whose been in a relationship with my wife for 18 years I was so happy to read this. Rarely do we hear a recognized actor as yourself cut through the bullshit and tell it like it is straight from the heart.

Of course, the one thing you should *always* do is max out Pact of Blood first.  I did it and by level 20 I had more hp than most players did at level 40.

Hanlong took a stake in Sundance a couple of years ago and was supposed to buy out the project for $1.1bn, and presumably front the $5bn or so it would have cost to develop it. The mine would have been one of the the biggest iron ore projects in the world. The Aussies still own the project but don't have the scratch to build it (it's in the middle of the jungle). And Hanlong remains a large shareholder. Nobody really knows what will become of their share, and by implication, whether the mine will be built. "
todayilearned,"&gt;For Thor the thought was always - ""of course the ancients could have done this - let me show you how""

His thought process was in the right place but it wasn't exactly ""how"" the ancients sailed. He more or less drifted whereas the [ancients had the technology](http://www.pbs.org/wayfinders/polynesian8.html) to sail the vast oceans and find small islands with pinpoint accuracy. 

This leads to the next thought. If the ancients could sail on marathon voyages to tiny islands with pinpoint accuracy, wouldn't it make sense they could sail to continents? My theory is something stopped them from making these voyages on a regular basis: warfare, resources, religion, etc)"
todayilearned,"i thought ""it's been done before"" but now we're not talking about the mac pro?

well, we sure aren't talking about laptops because only an insane person would compare a cheaper similar speced pc to a macbook.  they would only be similar specced in cpu, gpu, ram, and storage.  but a laptop is portable and includes a screen, keyboard, and trackpad.  so it needs an excellent battery, quality build structure and material, excellent trackpad, and good screen.  if you never interacted with the computer and had it compile scripts all day, then i guess you could compare them. :/

Compared to 42% of single women who ate breakfast &gt;5 times per week and 61% of married women who ate breakfast &gt;5 times per week.

Actually now that I look, they did include BMI for the women. The summary article just didn't mention it. 58% of the married men were overweight/obese compared to 39% of married women who were overweight/obese.

This is compared to 47% of single men being overweight/obese and 43% of single women being overweight/obese. "

science,"Silver and gold are nearly identical in terms of their 'wavelength' but appear quite different.  Many colors are composed of a combination of other colors, there is no 'wavelength' of light that corresponds to the color.  This point is made compelling when taken in consideration with what we know as color constancy.  Those yellowish lights you see in parking lots are often sodium lights, which emit a very narrow spectrum of light.  It's nearly all yellow.  Everything you see on a dark night under sodium lights is entirely and purely yellow.  There are no other colors making back to your eyes, yet we still manage to make out an intersting, vivid scene complete with colors.  If you find yourself walking through a parking lot lit as such, play a game with yourself and try to guess the color of each car as you pass.

iama,"We took it in turns swimming 1 hour slots, I think each swim i did just over 3km. I then got lucky and ended up doing the final 5mins of the swim to land at France. 

The most difficult part for me was the cold water and getting hypothermia many times during the years training. The hardest part totally was a 2hr qualification swim we had to complete in 14degree water in Dover, after a hour I nearly threw in the towel due to being seriously cold and in alot of pain with cramping. In a pool I can swim and swim and swim, so endurance wasnt an issue.

The hardest part on the day of the swim was for my hour swims, i'd always practiced in lakes and been able to drink and eat. On the day I had severe seasickness from the really bad weather, and was not able to eat and drink all day. This left me weak and out of my comfort zone as I had never trained under these conditions. "
science,"agreed. The current situation involves the US subsidizing the worlds food prices in exchange for controlling it if shit ever hit the fan. 

What the US should do, is end all food subsidies but act as the buyer of last resort in years where there is high yield/good weather, and sell those reserves into the market when their is drought to smooth out the volatility. It would be much cheaper than the subsidies regime, and not involving the government distorting signals that artificially cause supply to increase."

science,"11,00 cases and 3,900 deaths in the US for cervical cancer does make it rather rare, considering other cancers.  And of course we know that the vaccine protects against 4 of the 15 cancer causing strains.

Comparative numbers for other cancers:

In 2013, an estimated 232,340 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S., along with 64,640 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer.  About 2,240 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed in men in 2013.

science,"I skimmed the paper, and I don't know where NPR got the 2000 figure. The paper says

&gt;only
8.5–16.2% of the Central Park phylotypes had matches to
their respective databases

but it doesn't imply that the rest of the microbes were unique to Central Park, just that nobody had bothered to put them in a database until now. Their conclusion:

&gt;Together these results support previous speculation that
most soil diversity remains largely unexplored, meaning
the reference databases are far from complete and require
studies such as ours to minimize their over-representation
of well-studied and cultured lineages.

There's nothing in the paper to support NPR's quote."

As someone who was picked late in the draft and now considered a steal (and now on a team with Jeremy and Omer too!), what is your perspective on:

1. How fair/tough the draft process is for young athletes.

2. With all this talk about an amazing draft class next year (and tanking for it) how much teams are simply plain overlooking talent, and to their own detriment.

Current A.I.'s do not really form opions, but they can certainly learn on their own: Machine Learning is a well-established field.

science,"GT: 
Hi u/mismjames. Glad to hear that your dad responded well to the treatment. Radiotherapy can have side effects like you describe, particularly for NPC, because the tumour develops in the nasal cavity (i.e. in the middle of the head, surrounded by so many important tissues). Because it develops in a large empty space the tumour can grow to a large size before the patient realises something is amiss, so many patients preent with more advanced disease (which typically is harder to treat).  

About two thirds of the patients we enrol onto our clinical trials in the United Kingdom are not Chinese and don't have any links to the region. NPC does occur worldwide - but the incidence varies dramatically between Western countries and South East Asia. The other EBV cancers have a more uniform distribution, although incidence is more common in South East Asia.

What's it been like working without Clattenburg's direction? Easier? Harder? I'll be honest, I was a little worried this season wouldn't be up to scratch without him writing, but watching it completely dispelled those worries. Possibly my favourite season yet. Though I did wonder why you redid the puppet show as an episode.

Gary Lasereyes is easily my favourite cat name yet. It made me laugh out of nowhere the first time and then I couldn't stop."

You know those logos on curbs by drains with a picture of a dolphin that says ""No Dumping, Drains Directly to Ocean""?  I invented those in a Baywatch script called ""Heal The Bay"" where the lifeguards go out and paint them by drains.  Who know they would become real.

worldnews,"Obviously, the Polish government are not going to reveal their true intention to the media. Conducting military field training in an already tense circumstance in the region indicates that they're preparing for something. This isn't too dissimilar to the way the Russians said that they were only conducting a military drills beside Ukraine's border before they invaded. My guess is that the Polish Army is preparing to help the Ukrainian Army if Russia moves further into Ukraine passed Crimea. What Russia is doing at present in Crimea is trying to provoke a retaliation from the Ukrainian Army which would give them an excuse to move further into Ukraine or to invade Eastern Ukraine proper. That's very much a similar to what Russians did in Georgia; their strategy was to provoke a Georgia retaliation in South Ossetia, giving them an excuse to move further into Georgia. This in turn was a very similar scenario to Russian intervention in Transnistria in 1990 against Moldova. "
worldnews,"The part that particularly surprised me was how the USA thought they could indoctrinate democracy in Iraq. A revolution must come from within a country, otherwise it is meaningless and an invasion on the sovereignty of the nation. Regardless of whether North Korea, Iraq, or Syria would be better off without their corresponding *dictators*, is for them to decide, not the USA. There are certain conditions which could result in international action, but even then, everything must be done diplomatically first and a strategy must be planned out taking into consideration, the long term and abstract effects that an invasion could result in. The Iraq invasion was such a rushed, unplanned blitzkrieg, that it would have been bizarre to not see the effects that we are seeing today.

&gt;* Chinese researchers have discovered what they say is the first ‘virological penicillin’ – MIR2911, a molecule found naturally in a Chinese herb called honeysuckle.

&gt;* MIR2911 represses influenza viruses by targeting PB2 and NS1, two genes that are known to be required for influenza viral replication.

&gt;* However, the active anti-viral components and the mechanism by which they block viral replication have remained unclear.

todayilearned,"Women's Studies is a well accepted field of academia with very significant influence in the media and in education. It's generally well accepted throughout society. The fundamental premise of Women's Studies is that men rule the world and oppress women.

Thus, where they have influence, they share their opinions. Sometimes in poster form.

There's a counter-movement focused on men's issues here on Reddit, but most people don't believe they have a right to air any grievances because, after all, men *are* the problem."
worldnews,"There is no defending this cunts behavior or ignorance, but on the other hand this is a really authoritarian request considering the only thing that was hurt were feelings. They are literally asking the people of London to turn in any one who says any thing racist.  Which could lead to a lot of bull shit charges for people who are having a conversation and being reported for something taken out of context all because they think they will be a hero to the police or some moral crusader.  A lot of these European hate speech  laws which limits free speech are really getting scary. "
todayilearned,"Fair point, and I agree. But to be honest, I do make rape jokes and such. I have a dark and sometimes disgusting sense of humor. I don't do it to make other people laugh though. I do it because that's just the way my mind works, and it makes me laugh at the shitty side of life and death. It probably would be different if I weren't suicidally depressed, didn't get molested as a child, etc. Obviously, I don't go making holocaust jokes at the local temple, or rape jokes at a women's shelter, but I figured a suicide joke about Shia LaDouche on Reddit would be fine. I've been wrong before though..."
worldnews,"I understand that the problems are in need of solutions, I really do. But that is exactly what stems my question; which problems did OWS try to fix, and how? Did they accomplish anything? As someone who might not be familiar with the events during the time due to not even being in the country, it can be hard for me to get a clear picture when opinions are so fragmented. 

Bankers, inside trading, greater class disparity, etc etc, yes, I know. But asking WHY the movement failed is essential in understanding which problems exactly occurred during the time, and if they still do indeed keep occurring.

iama,"Ok, really big question that I don't think I can answer here comprehensively.  Would definitely invite you to check out a huge library of these policies that we've compiled for our Climatescope project here:
http://global-climatescope.org/en/policies/#/
The answer really varies but the overall trend has been that more countries are starting to embrace more supportive policies -- in part because doing clean energy is simply becoming more affordable in these nations.  Often, these new policies are more cost-conscious than the ones we've seen adopted in more developed nations.  Again, this is partly because poorer countries simply have less to spend. But it's also because richer countries have adopted enough clean energy to help drive down costs.  That's helped make clean energy more viable in the developing world.  I don't know that that was what Germany/Italy/Spain/etc's had in mind when they put those policies in place, but it's helped!"
iama,"Huh.  I didn't know that about Mr. Patinkin.  Cool!

The iridotomy was to mitigate one of the side effects of the ICL.  In early ICL trials, they noticed that the implant was partially blocking the flow of the aqueous humor, the fluid that fills the front part of the eye.  Flow blockage was resulting in high pressure inside the eye, a major risk factor/cause of glaucoma.

The aqueous humor, in a regular eye, is produced inside the eye, flows out through the pupil, and drains into the body through some membranes between the cornea and the iris.  The iridotomy puts extra holes in the iris, giving the aqueous humor more exit points, to increase outflow.  The increased outflow from the iridotomy cancels out the decreased outflow from the implant, so you don't get a pressure rise."
iama,"Hello Mr. Gatiss,

first, I'd like to ask you for one thing: promise me to never die! As Mycroft, I mean. The thought scares me. He s my dream man, you see. And the idea that someone likes him directs the world makes me feel optimistic - I mean, if he doesn't, then it's all just chaos, isn't it?

And now for the questions: do you ever plan for Mycroft to take Sherlock's advice and become a little more human? (Not necessarily in the way Sherlock recommended - Mycroft with a goldfish is inconceivable.)

And, if you had to choose between becoming Mycroft and becoming your character from Game of Thrones, who would you pick?"
worldnews,"You mean the truth of Muslimculturalism for all white nations. Because you won't see Indians spreading their culture to your countries. We keep our culture to ourselves and in our private properties, because we think its inappropriate to come to another country and display our culture loudly and try to dominate the majority culture. It is wrong and we expect the same from the rest when they come to ours. Of course, muslims are like an invasive parasite who will continue to try and consume all in their path. "
iama,"Hey guys, just wanted to thank you first of all for all the years of fucking hilarious, weed-stanked, piss-stained, greasy-ass comedy! You guys are the fucking KINGS in my book, much respect and love for your show, movies, tour, and recently this AMA.

I have a few questions, even though i'm probably late as always:

1. What are you drinking, Julian? I think i read it was iced-tea or regular coke somewhere, but i still want it from the sexy horses mouth.

2.Ricky, thanks for bringing back the chicken-foot shirt. It was always my favorite! Do you often ad-lib, or are your ''Rickyisms'' written and rehearsed?

3.Bubbles! I got your belly, first of all. Secondly, how was it to play with Rush? Those guys are legends in my book and it was really crazy to see you collaborate.

Boys, thanks for another great season and you guys fuckin' ROCK!"
todayilearned,"Edit: read more on it,

Seems like it will be a replacement for various tactical aircraft, including the US F-16, A-10, F/A-18, AV-8B and British Harrier GR7 &amp; GR9s, and the Canadian CF-18 and probably a few others.

So while the cost seems super high, Its a replacement for what otherwise would be multiple other aircraft which would cost MUCH more to research and develop and purchase new planes for, along with all the equipment factories and so on for each individual aircraft type.

On top of that its a replacement for 8000+ aircraft, so it is not an addition to the current force.
 

Its probably saving a few hundred billion if not another trillion from combining them together into one aircraft system.

askreddit,"It could very well be an internal hemorrhoid. That happens when you have hard stool that you have to strain out all of the time (the key here being constant straining). And internal ones prolapse, and can often be pushed back in. Fresh, bright-red blood is a good indicator. Internal hemorrhoids are fairly painless though, so you might have an external one (that's thrombosed) if it hurts that badly. You should be able to see a doctor on-campus; that's what I did. A doctor's exam should definitely be next on your list, but if it is a hemorrhoid you shouldn't worry too much--the doctor will give you at-home treatment, and the butt pillows don't go away you can opt to have them removed easily by a surgeon. 

Edit: Oh, and increasing your fiber intake (at least to soften-up the stool!) would probably help. "
iama,"""Boba Fett? Boba Fett, where?"" -Han.

Who is your favorite bounty hunter from the Star Wars universe, besides Boba?

My wife and I are getting ready to finish watching SW in the Machete order, and I'm curious about how you feel about watching it in that order or if you are a Original, then second trilogy kind of guy or if you prefer watching 1 though 6. [Machete Order link](http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/) for those curious.

And lastly, forgive my ignorance and a simple IMDB search would probably answer but I've been an longtime SW fan but am fairly new to Dr. Who. What role did you play?"
iama,"That's a tough question. And hard to really answer without seeing your tax return and how you file. If you file single with no dependents, under the age of 25 and not a student (for example) you couldn't really have withholding not taken out of your check and still have a refund at the end of the year. You would most certainly owe us and face a plethora of unnecessary penalties as a result.

Now if you're working a minimum wage job and have dependents, that's a different story. You could essentially have no withholding taken out and qualify for enough tax credits and refundable credits to offset your tax liability and then get some back.

So it all really depends. "
askreddit,"At my school, we learned about many revolutions as well. I think it's important to look at many revolutions and see why they occurred. I believe there's a reason that we learn history--so that we don't repeat it or in the case of revolutions see how different countries have handled similar conflicts. Also, it can help you learn about why a culture is the way it is now, e.g. Mexico and all of her years of failed revolutions and reforms. 
So good on you, DoDaDaTheIdiot's school. Good on you.
P.S. I'm from the U.S."
worldnews,"If you look at the 30's the far right took over in Germany and Japan. Germany decided that Britain and France would not stop it remilitarizing the Rhineland (German troops were apparently told to pull back if they encountered resistance), and invading the Sudetenland and then Poland. 

Meanwhile Japan did consider the US a long term threat to its territorial ambitions and mounted a preemptive strike at Pearl Harbor. Still all countries ended up a war eventually because allowing Japan and Germany a bit of expansion pretty much inevitably lead to war since Japan and Germany just interpreted that as a sign that the democracies were all weak and if they wouldn't fight over China, Czechoslovakia or Poland they wouldn't fight at all."
worldnews,"LOL. You're adorable.  It's like you have a stock of denials like ""beating the moral relativism drum"" or ""putting words in my mouth"" or ""changing the topic"" or ""blithering idocy"" so that whenever I point out how unrealistic your posts are, you just pick one so you can pretend everything I said didn't matter.

I'm not the one changing the topic.  Once again, **YOU** were the one who decided to bring my character and background into this.  If the topic changed, you were the one who changed it when you decided to start lying about me.

Are you really so uncertain on the chain of events here that you can't even remember what you yourself wrote just a couple posts ago?  If you didn't want the topic to change to that of your fictions about my history, you shouldn't have decided to lie about me.

Otherwise, as you're the guy who thinks that freedom is measured in square inches, and has nothing to do with morality, I'm really not sure what else there is to say there."
iama,"That’s extraordinary! The worst thing about that is I remember someone coming and saying, “Hey, Jeremy look at this!” And they pulled up their shirt and there was a tattoo of Boba Fett. He said, could you just sign this Mr. Bulloch? It would be very nice of you!” So with a felt tipped pen, I signed my name. Not long after that, this guy comes up to me and said, “Look Mr. Bulloch!”  There was his sizzling flesh with my name, which I had written. He had it tattooed right on his bare flesh.

Lots of people coming up with some of the artwork is fantastic/ It’s not too late to get a Boba Fett tattoo!"
todayilearned,"The odds of that happening are rather high considering the number of twins born every year. If we say it could happen during one hour out of all the hours in a year that'd be a probabilty of 1/(24*365) = 1/8760 which is roughly 0.01%. So for every 8760 sets of twins born in the world, per year, there's 1 set of twins born like this. I don't know if there's even that many sets born in a year, you can get more fancy with the numbers if you'd like. (Also if you want to be more precise we should double 8760 maybe; if we say on average it takes 30 minutes to get the second baby out, then the golden time we can have this happen is in the second half-hour before DST kicks in, because in a half an hour the second baby will come out after DST changed.)"
iama,"To make it clear- I'm was caucasian kid from Westchester County, NY. Economics was a factor only in that I didn't have the money to hire a private lawyer, investigator or experts. I had to use a public defender who not only failed miserably but provided me with ineffective representation. He never presented my alabi witness in court, never explained to the jury the significance of the DNA not matching me, never cross examined the medical examiner (whose fraud was crucial), very rarely spent any time meeting with me, refused to allow me to testify and never rebutted several of the prosecutions erroneous theories"
todayilearned,Admittedly I was being (poorly) hyperbolic with hundred of years comment. No where in the court settlement does it state vaccines cause autism no where. Your source was Dan Olmsted known to have a bias that who you sourced and the link to settlement was dead on your source's page.

Also capital letters at the start of your sentences.  
worldnews,"It is incredibly long odds that someone would be a 69 year old captain and have never run into at least several situations that would have got his adrenaline pumping. You're bound to have plenty of near misses in a career that long. And like I already mentioned, even if you've never been directly exposed to such a situation, the safety procedures that you are supposed to train on have been developed by those that have experienced previous disasters and if you actually bother taking them seriously, make it possible to adequately react even when in a panic mode."
askreddit,"I am a masterful navigator, remembering the layouts and street names of places that I've only been to once, but for some reason there are a few street names that I continuously forget. It's like somewhere in my brain there is a list of street names to always forget, no matter how much I try not not to. The worst part is that they aren't even places that I rarely go, one of them is even near my house, but whenever I try to recall the name I draw a blank, or my brain just substitutes the name for something else."
science,"There are patented organic seeds too. This is an issue with the entire industry, not just Monsanto. Likewise, farmers have plenty of options outside of Monsanto; no one forces them to purchase Round-Up Ready seeds or other Monsanto products. Remember that Monsanto has competitors (contrary to common belief, Monsanto is not the biggest fish in the biotech field, granted it is up there) who would be more than happy to sell their product to disgruntled farmers if given the chance. Companies like Syngenta, Bayer, DuPont, BASF, and DowAgro are quite successful for a reason. "
iama,"We indeed originated from Africa but we don't have an African ethnicity nor share any kind of African identity, whereas the land of Israel was a major and important part of the Jewish identity and culture for over 2,000 years, during which the Jewish people were always treated as foreigners in Europe and in any other place they lived in.

Academically the post-Colonial criticism of Israel is an absurd and a widely criticized position. There are such obvious differences between the Jewish immigration to Israel and what you call ""classic colonial immigration"" that it's hard to take any of your arguments seriously. "
science,"Getting chocolate and Coca-Cola to Phoenix is trivial.  There is a large amount of infrastructure that is readily available, there is a population willing to pay for the cost of goods and transport, there isn't a warlord who captures all of the produce that arrives at the Arizona border, and there aren't camps of refugees who have to relocate every month because no one wants them.  

Nothing in your comment invalidates my claim that the quantity of food produced in the world is not the issue.  We produce enough food, the issue is that the food is not accessible to those who are hungry.  This is a logistics problem, not a food production problem. "

It's not even because of islam, just traditional clothing.

This supports my general idea that it isn't corporate offices that are (generally) at fault in customer service problems. They really do try their best to ensure customers have the best experience. 9 times out of 10, a bad experience is the result of someone at the local level and corporate is not only willing to work with you, but will take appropriate action with the employee at the local level to ensure every customer has the best experience."
science,"What the article is saying is despite popular believe, there aren't any long term effects on the body like other substances. What happens when you're on the substance is arguably different from being harmful. Not everyone should go out and drop acid because its now shown to be physically harmless, but all in all if you do, be in a safe area and don't do as much as you can get your hands on. I'm not saying what happened to the kid in your city isn't to be blamed on the LSD, but that situation could have been caused by a number of situational problems that led to the ""bad trip"" like watching certain things on tv, friends saying/doing things to scare him/her, etc. "
science,"There has never been even a single lawsuit where a farmer was sued for accidental contamination by neighbouring GMO crops. Monsanto has won every case they've brought to court because they've been able to prove that the farm purposefully planted their crop with seeds they knew to be GMO. 

Don't believe me? Find me an actual case (not just a one-sided blog post) that proves me wrong. 

Monsanto Inc Canada v. Schmeisner is one example of a farmer purposefully isolating and planting GMO seeds.

Organic Seed Farmers and Trade Association v. Monsanto is a case where a group of farmers attempted to sue Monsanto to protect themselves from lawsuits for accidental contamination. The suit was thrown out, by two judges, when the farmers failed to provide even a single instance where Monsanto had sued a farm for accidental or trace contamination by GMO's.

Maybe look beyond a single, extremely biased ""documentary"" to get your information. "
science,"Psychopaths are unpredictable.  And besides, capitalism removes such a necessity.  You can blind perfectly good people to the harm they cause with nothing more than a suitably sized bribe.  The less well off the individual and their family, the cheaper it is.

And when that doesn't work, there's always the time-tested threat of bodily, emotional, or social harm to fall back upon.

The only measure of psychopath they'd be *sure* to meet at that point, is the mental duality they create to cope with their own unique situation, which may well put them at odds with reality itself."

The alleged weapons programs were, quite famously, *never found*.  But you managed to confuse weapons programs from two different fucking **centuries**, then accused *others* of moving the goalposts.  "
science,"You forget corn. Its ancestral forms were so WTF that I'm surprised Native Americans kept it around for that long.

In terms of modern (eg. 20th century) science, people ""created"" new strains by mutagenesis. They would literally bombard crops with UV/gamma radiation, plant them in fields exposed to the environment, and see what came out. For those who are worried about health and environmental concerns, this is far more risky. But of course, the USDA approved these foods rather than the FDA. For some reason, whole-scale genetic changes are OK but changing/inserting several genes is not.

We have the power of hindsight to show that broad-scale/coarse mutagenesis methods are safe. Nobody ever seriously thought that this would be dangerous to the public. While the safety concern in GMO food is strain-specific, we should treat it with appropriate and proportional scrutiny, not hysteria."
science,"So the study is making it apparent that conditions in other parts of the world are getting worse.  Yet nothing is being done about it, while America on the other hand has been industrialized first and has learned how to keep pollution down and less harmful to the environment.  So in a way just because America has been industrialized longer does not make it a bad thing in the long run, as to where its the 20th century and there are new ways to stop all the pollution and countries are doing nothing about it.  So looking forward other countries will catch up and or be worse then America on this subject while America will jsut be blamed at this point in time as contributing 22% to global warming, which is still not considered to be true or false.

science,"&gt;Mononucleosis rarely leads to a serious condition called chronic active EBV infection, which is characterized by persistent illness more than six months after the initial mononucleosis diagnosis.

&gt;If you're experiencing signs or symptoms of mononucleosis — such as fatigue, weakness, fever, sore throat and swollen lymph nodes — and you've had mono before, consult your doctor to determine the cause of your current symptoms. Keep in mind that many other conditions, such as hepatitis and toxoplasmosis, can mimic the symptoms of mononucleosis.

It is also rare, but mono can reactivate with symptoms if your immune system is weak or compromised.  Being chronically tired and stressed can also weaken the immune system, which could cause mono to reactivate with symptoms.

As a computer science major, I've been hearing about how computer science and the way computers work have been influenced by neuroscience ever since their respective inceptions. However, I also recently heard that the way science understands that memory is stored in the brain has changed a lot in recent years. Specifically, it's (from what I've heard) now understood that memories are stored in **every** part of the brain rather than in specific sections.

Basically, my question is, is this true? And if so, how has it influenced neuroscience as a whole?"

Things that made the difference a little bit more even: I had to pay for the plane ticket, plus rent was a little bit more expensive, groceries are more expensive, ate out a lot more often, travel in Tokyo is quite expensive (inside the city), and also traveling to see places in general (plus admission fees to museums/parks/temples/etc that you want to go to)."

and, fwiw, if you understand darwinian natural selection, nothing is ""meant"" to be a certain way or ""evolved"" to do anything in particular. The ancestors of cows found themselves on grassy plans, and those that could do decently well eating the leaves, stems and seeds of monocots that were prevalent there were more likely to survive to reproduce. That does NOT mean corn is not equally OK for them, or even superior.  

Evolution does not pick what is the best fit, but rather what, out of the existing choices, sucks the least."

Our intention was always to get things right and we got a hard lesson in just how much further we had to go.  Greg and his colleagues at MUSA made it all happen."

What was a wrong decision had to be given to the wrong people - and eventually, you'll get a right.  That is a costly &amp; failed Soviet expansion.  To expect Pakistan to change for the better after all that, alongside China's military buffing, you would need the mother of all revolutions."
iama,"Yes, I was diagnosed with PTSD after I survived a double suicide truck bombing in Baghdad.  As a foreign correspondent, after each story I did, I would lock the horrible things I saw in the back of my mind, sure that they would stay there forever. They did not. Everything was unleashed in 2006 after the bombing. I worked with some great therapists who got me through those tough times.

Now we have to be there for our returning Vets and make sure they don't have to walk down that dark path for as long as I did. Mike"
science,"Having one of each wouldn't necessarily give you the benefits of both, one will most likely be dominant over the other. As far as the immune system goes, it is unlikely that the mutated MOGS would be recognized by the immune system. The portion of the immune system that would recognize this sort of change is the T-cell. For a T-cell to recognize the change it would need to occur in a portion of the protein that the T-cell can 'see'. So a mutation in a random part of this gene is unlikely to result in rejection because it is unlikely for the mutation to occur somewhere a T-cell can see it."

Is it hard to get parents to agree to have their kids in the show? I would think that many parents, finding out that their kids would be subjected to a lifetimes worth of cussing and greasiness, would say no fuckin way? I know mine would have. 

You put ""help my fuck"" in season 8 a few times, which was fuckin great. Previously, I think the only person who said this was Ray when talking about how he feels like the luckiest man in the world to be living in his western star sleeper. Did you do this in order to get a bit of Ray in there, since he wasn't in season 8, or was it simply cause it's a hilarious comment?

Keep up the amazing and hilarious work!

science,"This is all news to me. I'm a GMO sceptic and I've never seen it linked to autism, obesity or cancer (at least not directly).

And I do support vaccines (with a little care). 9/11 I have no idea about. 

So, the world's not black and white. Maybe in the US where everything is polarised into 2 camps on everything, but not everyone has such cartoonish views. You may be creating a caricature for a strawman.

My question is: what is the actual case for GMO in general? There is plenty of food in the world, no-one is hungry because of a lack of GMO. It's always touted that GMO will solve hunger, but a moment's thought shows that to be false. So, why are people so in favour of them? I could understand people being ok or neutral with them, what I don't understand is the evangelical zeal of Redditors who insist we MUST use them.

iama,"Just as a customer this has been my experience. Goodwill in Utah near the big ski hills has some expensive brands on a regular basis. Sacramento area has Goodwills with gross stuff. Reno has a bit of a blend of scuzzy and occasional gold mines. I shop at the one here in Montana with the most regular consistency. I gained about 35lbs over the course of 2 years. On a student's budget I can't afford to buy new clothes very often and hate the idea of spending much on clothes when trying to lose weight. Goodwill here has enough nice things that I can update my wardrobe every couple of months. I have to have decent clothes when I go to conferences, when doing thesis interviews, and when I mediate justice court cases. This is the only way I can get them. Other thrift stores here charge 2-3 times as much, especially for brands like Laurel Creek, Guess, and Carhart. Plus they give a small extra discount to students."

All in all, ISIS probably does control less than is shown on the map, but how much less is really difficult to say; however some territorial losses are shown."

science,"In simple terms the main problem with adapting is the changingrate every dna or rna has. A virus has a very high generation rate compared to the human and a very short rna that means that statistically it is much more likely for a virus to ""find"" the right combination to be effective than for us to be immune to it just by brute force method. You must never forget that in this process billions of wrong changes will be discharged. Those virus strains won't be present for us because they are unable to infect us. They only ""win"" because of their huge number. Though we could not die enough times to get immune to everything, so big cellclusters like us have to adapt in other ways but for a small virus it is quite simple. They are build to infect, they have no other option. No infection means no survival. "

Of course being able to fully understand what is being said isn't something I would want to give up, there were positive aspects.

iama,"Thanks for your question!  The main electro-magnet for levitation is in the base station which is only on when connected to power.  When its on, the magnetic field is facing upwards so it won’t impact any nearby devices.  The only thing to be careful about is putting credit cards or other magnetically sensitive items directly on a powered base station.  The neo-magnet in the Orb is only strong enough to provide opposing force for levitation. The Orb is not capable of producing a strong enough magnetic field to cause problems with devices that might be susceptible to magnetic influence.  I know it's anecdotal but I’ve been carrying around the orb in my backpack with my laptop for months with no problems.  Other members of our team have been doing the same."

Russia would have to feel extremely threatened to cut off this revenue source, and eastern Ukraine isn't going to be enough.

Also, China would not side with Russia. There is a burgeoning alliance with Russia, but the Chinese economy is so deeply intertwined with the US that their position would certainly be neutrality.

I'm pretty sure a psychopath scientist would be much scarier than a superintelligent AI. A superintelligent AI would try to solve problems if it has ""likes"" (values). Otherwise it would simply serve its master (a human) if it is programmed to value loyalty/obedience. 

Evolution has given us things like ""Survival"" and ""fear"". This won't exist in AI, therefore, it has no reason to harm humans even if humans want to shut it down or whatever."

There are obviously some stereotypes, but mostly good! Majority of Iranians love Americans and their culture... And they follow it as well. They listen to American hip hop, pop, rock and almost everything else. They also watch all Americans TV series like Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, The Big Bang Theory, Lost, Prison Break, ... and almost everything else...


I did feel a little bit of culture shock, but not anything big. There were differences, but I got used to it pretty fast.

Also, my background hinders me when it comes to dating women: after all, who wants to go out with a guy who spent 16 years in prison! :(

No. I never felt like a criminal, I was always painfully aware that I didn't belong in there. Many prisoners that I knew had worked themselves into a mental place in which they recognized that they did this to themsevles. I could never get there, since I was innocent"
todayilearned,"When I first watched it, I had never seen a war movie as realistic as it at that point. The opening Normandy landing scene was shocking, and the last battle at the end of the movie was quite unnerving. This was a few years before I joined the Army. My grandfather was a WWII vet and jumped on D-Day, and was in the 101st Airborne Div, 502 PIR. The guys in Band of Brothers were 506, but they were all there. 

When he saw SPR, mainly the opening scene of the Normandy landings, he said that's the closest thing he had seen in a movie depicting what combat is actually like. Even then, he said that no movie, no matter how graphic, could compare to the real thing. 

After WWII he went on to fight in Korea, but he never talked about that war. Occasionally he would talk a little bit about WWII, but NEVER the Korean War. When I asked him about it as a kid, he would always get a dark look on his face and say ""Don't wanna talk about it."""

askreddit,"I would take a trip forward in time about 10 years. This would be far enough for many changes to have occurred, but not so far that I would be likely to be seriously out of place. I would spend some time looking up stock prices, winning lottery numbers, technology developments, significant political developments etc. I would plan to use this information to set myself up for success in financial and business situations.

I would then meet myself at a pre-appointed location and compare notes about the successes and failures I had attempting to implement the plans. Did the lottery numbers work? What about the stock tips? Did they work ok at first, then start to diverge as my activities changed the market? Was I happy with my life over the past 10 years? Is there any advice I would give myself to create a better outcome? I would use this information to develop a good strategy for when I get back to the past.

Then I'd go back and put the information I found to work."
worldnews,"I don't know why people are downvoting you, you are 100% correct.

The issue at hand is why the separatists fighting had the equipment to bring down that plane but not the knowledge to not shoot down passenger planes. There is a level of responsibility for many people along the chain of events that led to that point - you can't just be shooting at random planes because you didn't know better - that is beyond criminal negligence. But it isn't deliberately shooting down a passenger plane because they are ""terrorists.""

todayilearned,"To be fair, they likely got into their profession to help people 1-on-1 rather than wrangle with a computer on wheels. We heard a lot of complaints from front-line staff that learning to use the computer was drastically cutting into their time actually helping the patients.

After they learned to use the system though, those complaints mostly died down as staff realized that the software helps them chart more accurately, more robustly, and more cleanly (you don't have to read doctor's handwriting when it's been typed into the system or they used text-to-speech)."
todayilearned,"Disclaimer: these are not my opinions, but merely what I'm told by others:

My wife and several of my close friends are doctors, and the arguments for residents doing long hours comes down to training and experience.  The point of residency is to give a new doctor access to all kinds of experiences, and it's meant to cram in a lifetime's worth of challenges into a few years.

Plus, there is some aspect (according to one friend) of teaching a future attending physician how to work under adverse conditions.  Learning how to work under long, stressful hours is in many ways an acquired skill, so making sure that every doctor knows their coping mechanisms when they're tired and stressed out is in some ways useful if they ever need to do that later under some kind of emergency scenario."
iama,"Good question.

From what I've seen, the Tea Party views liberals in distinctive ways.

Some view them as welfare queens, or flag hating college kids living in their mother's basements, etc, etc.

The Tea Party typically doesn't view them as a large segment of the population, but instead as a society of America haters. It's quite interesting the interactions between Tea Partiers and liberals.

Occasionally at rallies we'll have some liberal students from nearby campuses come over and debate with some of the protesters. 

I used to get angry but the Tea Party ralliers would just spew whatever chain email, Rush Limbaugh sound byte, etc they've ever heard and some of the college kids would just laugh at the stupidity.

If she's on your leg jumping, give a swift swipe to break the contact (not to hurt her at all!) and say uh-uh - off! and be consistent with it.
For people who encourage her to jump, tell them you don't want them too, otherwise she'll never get the message.
If she won't stay down, hold the leash down with your foot and when she is calm praise her.
Continually praise her for not jumping and give her a firm UH UH when she is and ignoring her to get her to stop.

science,"Not necessarily, because of horizontal gene transfer.  Bacteria can trade loops of DNA called plasmids that code for particular traits, even if they're not of the same species.  It's just what they do, it fills a similar niche to sex, mixing up the gene pool.  You wouldn't want your gut bacteria giving some invading nasty the key to the kingdom.

This is one of the reasons you always end up feeling like crap when you complete a course of antibiotics-  it has to wipe out your gut bacteria so they don't become antibiotic-resistant and pass the genes on to whatever lurking horror lives in the sewers.

worldnews,"You assume it was the rebels, but the plane went down far outside the range of anything they could potentially be using (like the BUK SAM system). There were also plenty of other planes in the area at the time, many closer to the fighting than that one, and no doubt there have been countless planes overflying the conflict zone (which seems like a pretty dumb idea in the first place). I just don't buy that the rebels would single out that one plane now when they really can't afford to be making mistakes. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military is floundering.

Based on the severity and desperateness with which Kiev has been making accusations, I would guess that if it was actually shot down, it was a false flag by them in an effort to get the international community to help them militarily."

A glans without a foreskin does become desensitized. 

I've also read that removing the clitoral hood is more hygienic. When smegma collects in the groove around the clitoral hood it smells and collects bacteria and other germs. Yet, people don't do that for female hygiene because they realize it's unnecessary. It's equally unnecessary for boys. You're simply biased. "

science,"Personally, depression worsens when you have to take the blame for it. Being diagnosed with depression helps identify yourself as separate from this overwhelming feeling and really helps with overcoming depression. With more physical proof of this ""separation of depression and self"" it might take the guilt off being depressed and lead more people to treatment. 

Staying quiet is deadly, shame alone kept me quiet and alone for four years even with treatment available. It's sad that others go through that or worse, but many, in my family alone, have. People need to take depression more seriously, it is deadly, it makes you feel and think ways you never would, and in some cased do things. Depression affects millions and kills too, we need more studies and research into it like this. "

iama,I have all of your Now Eat This cookbooks and love them! I cook from them regularly and have never been disappointed with any of the recipes I've made. I looked through The Pound a Day Diet book and noticed most of the menus average around 850 calories per day. I've been told by a few different Registered Dieticians (RD) that a woman should never eat fewer than 1200 calories per day and men shouldn't eat fewer than 1500 calories per day in order to keep the metabolism running smoothly. I'm just curious why the calorie counts are so low on the plan in your book and whether you worked with an RD in developing it.

He has no serious consequences for his actions and gets to live a ""normal"" life, meanwhile my daughter has a bullet in her back, has pain in her feet when she walks, and can't have children. Maybe is she was stabbed with a pencil I'd be a little more forgiving. 
In one of his depositions he said he meant to put the gun in his backpack and swing it at his bully makes absolutely no sense. Why else would you put a gun in your backpack?

As for the gun owner, his lawyer placed the blame on the child, right now it's a good possibility he isn't even going to face criminal charges for his negligence. "

iama,"Britain oddly enough has had a higher rate of home invasions per capita than the US.  And more people suffering disfiguring injuries from broken glasses........

And even in your country, if you know the right people, any idiot can buy a gun.  If outlawing guns worked at all, you would have 0 gun deaths.

Outlawing them would reduce the number of LEGALLY owned guns in the US.  The number of illegal guns would increase and would continue.  And crime involving guns would skyrocket because the criminals would have nothing to be afraid of.  This has been proven in several small cities.  And one in particular then changed their laws to require EVERY household has a gun.  And their crime rates plummeted across the board.

If you look at the statistics, areas with high rates of legal gun ownership have less crime in general, and usually much less gun crime.  Sure Britain has less gun crime, but every other kind of violent crime saw a marked increase when you outlawed guns."

If the still insanely good special effects in 2001 floored you, wait til you see what they were able to do almost 100 years ago in Germany.

I mean, we have the ability to resist these impulses, but why would we? Delayed gratification? Grief? Depression? Martyrdom for a larger cause?

science,"* Yes, for sure.  There's even large overarching behavioral differences we can see that seem quite obvious.  Even dietary preference is different in that males of many species require much less in the way of protein since they aren't producing eggs, which are incredibly costly.

science,"People really don't think deeply enough about this stuff. Some GM crops are modified to be resistant to Roundup.

iama,"I can second this. Three years ago, while chaperoning American students at a university in Beijing, one of the girls in our group brought up tianenman with a Chinese student and had the girl come up to her the next day explaining that her parents were party members and she was no longer allowed to be her friend. In addition, tianenman was a subject Chinese students were unaware of, blocked on websites, and it was advised we shouldn't discuss it so as to avoid causing a stir. This was at the end of a semester living there and studying, and I believe the topic came up because someone was doing a paper on censorship in China (in a strictly American class). I don't know of any other cases because this came up at the end of the trip and we were only just aware of the limits of Chinese history just before we left.

If it was the Separatists, and not the Russians, who shot down this plane it would be pretext for aid by western nations in shutting down groups with this ability to not just threaten, but actually engage and eliminate citizens of western allied nations. We could in this instance call his bluff and publicly state seeking an alliance with Russia in removing these threats, or their ability. It would back them into a corner, as if they are Russian troops then their denial would say basically admit that. But, if they aren't, then their support would allow us to assist in removing the threat. It's more of a geopolitical underhanded strong-arming on the part of western nations than a threat of war. "

My parents were sucked into this cult, yes.  Now that several years have passed, my parents do love and accept me.  It may not be the way I wish, as they never ask me about my dating life, I still have them in my life.  I believe family is important and I believe my parents are victims to this cult when they felt they were at a time of need."

science,"Awesome! I just talked about this in an indirect way on another sub!

So, in 2010, I was diagnosed with AML. Went through chemo therapy. I was clean till 2012 when it came back and I needed a bone marrow transplant. I got a 10/10 HLA unrelated donor transplant. Went fine, no major scares or anything. Had a flair up of the BK virus for about two of the most agonizing weeks of my life, but little to no GvHD and so forth. In 2014, I had hemolytic anemia that put me in the hospital. In the bone marrow biopsy that I had, they found EBV in my marrow. They think that this was the cause of the hemolytic anemia.

My question: I had mono when I was about 14, why didn't I get side effects or symptoms of the EBV while I was on chemo? Is it possible that EBV could have survived the sterilization protocol that the donor cells went through, so by proxy, my donor could have given me a new case of mono? If so, why would it have taken roughly 1 and half years post transplant to manifest?

Thank you!"

In Richard Dawkins ""The Selfish Gene"" he disregarded the entire field of anthropology in a page and a half and I never could understand why. We study other species predators to better understand how they have adapted to their environment, well for humans our predators are us. I don't understand how alpha human predators, who killed millions and bred thousands wouldn't have effected our evolution as a species. I've always thought this line of reasoning might hold the key to this question. That a military force (human predators) might be more effective when its members acted altruistically towards one another. This would lead to the tribes with more altruistic citizens being more effective in combat and killing off their rival tribes, thus out breeding them."

Given that the Ukraine had a cargo jet blown out of the sky on Monday you  can't make a case that this was a a tragic case of defensive actions gone wrong.

The Iranian shoot down and the KAL 902 disaster were overly aggressive commanders reacting to a perceived threat. This is Russia trying to take away Ukrainian sovereignty over the air airspace in eastern Ukraine. 

If this really was a Russian SAM it's hard to not see it as a war crime. Not that such things seem to matter to anyone anymore. "

The brain is a dynamic and ever changing tool and to look at these ""disorders"" as you would look at a medical illness is IMO wrong. "

They also said that all of the sales reps for UAV companies will outright lie about the current state of affairs with the FAA, because its threatening to put their companies out of business. "

If it played out like genital mutilation, then we would have to argue that gay men being beaten is a non-issue compared to the killing of lesbian. Meanwhile, gay men would be arguing that harming anyone for their sexual orientation is bad. Meanwhile people would argue that talking about stopping harm to all homosexuals, regardless of sex, is somehow taking away from the discussion of the abuse of lesbians.

science,"It is fascinating that they are alive! I think this gene has already been well-studied for this purpose- the novel thing being that this mutation is compatible with life. 

The problem is that when MOGS is messed with (liked knocked down with siRNA), the good glycosylation events that are critical to the cell are prevented, as well as those necessary for virus replication. I think the hope here would be that delivery could be targeted to a particular tissue and cease before that tissue is completely destroyed (like radiation for cancer treatment). These kids being alive demonstrates that the line where the tissue is destroyed can potentially be moved far further back than what we previously thought. 

Now, if we can only replicate their heartiness and get viruses to stay in one location, we are all set. "
todayilearned,"What are the alternatives, though? Abstinence programs just say don't do it. They don't work because it's difficult to suppress natural tendencies through some socially constructed ideal. Instead, education presents as the best option. 

I don't think it's a true comparison, or at least not in the way you mean. NSPs educate those that participate by addressing the biggest concern with IDU, which is the spread of disease. It's like how sex ed emphasizes the dangers of unsafe sex and STD transmission, rather than telling people to ""just say no,"" which contributes to its effectiveness. "

Even at 20k, it isn't big enough to replace the other big entitlement programs.

20k a year won't be enough to pay for Grandma's food, house, medicine, and new hip. She paid into social security and Medicare for her whole life, and the country won't watch her die.

It is also common for people in leading positions or engineers to be employed in a way where hours are not counted which often means quite a lot of overtime in return for nice benefits and/or nice wage."
iama,"Wow, coincidentally I've recently been daydreaming/wondering what drones can do.  Are the research efforts being directed at a comprehensive drone approach?  For example, a set of ground drones patrolling the fields and hunting down weeds acutely rather than dusting whole fields with Glyphosates and relying on GMO crops to resist the spray.  Aerial drones spotting wildlife and using pre-set signals to which guard dogs or drones are trained to key in on.  Etc.  Is the ultimate goal to make these systems set and forget, with sort of a central hub from which farmers and farm hands can ""train"" the fleet to suit their needs?  "
iama,"I've always been dominant and have used NLP in my storytelling/writing for the longest time before I even knew what it was. Started investigating hypnosis when I was 14 after reading it in a magazine and it elaborated from there.

There's many kinds of funny; one of my favourites was a girl that thought she couldn't be hypnotized and it almost took no more than a snap to bring her under. It was at a party so merriment was had by all.

Oooh! And another really funny one; I was hypnotising a guy to feel like a mouse (his choice) and a female subject of mine came walking into the room and, without really thinking, I triggered her into her ""cat"" state. They spent a couple of minutes chasing and both of them (after waking them) had loved it for the sheer fun and silliness of it all."
todayilearned,"I work in the CBRNe field and have done live agent training. One particular location was in DRDC, located about 3 hours east of Calgary.  a lot of the training that we were doing involving CWA's were from old munitions that were fired back in the 60's and 70's, and just never exploded.  So to say that what is inside these canisters is no longer viable, is false.  however there is a lot of water in the ocean, and if the contents did release (or already has), we wouldnt know because of how diluted it would be.  So your point about the drumming up fear is pretty accurate."
worldnews,"I did not consider that as an effective integration measure as it affects the whole of society. What I mean by integration measure is various counseling methods to new arrivals, basic assimilation assistance so people from other countries settling in Spain know what to expect and respect. Educate people. Sorta like instead of banning drugs, you legalize them but spend a lot of effort on preventative education. A well informed public always beats out punitive action in my opinion. And I do think it is absolutely ridiculous that government or anyone else should be able to tell me how I should dress. "
iama,"&gt;P.S. You still haven't proven that anyone on earth has ever said ""Chinesefood."" 

Really? That's the straw you're clutching on to? Despite the dozens of examples I provided, you think if you really drill me down on people using the word ""chinesefood"" you'll inexplicably come out of this with your pride intact? Trust me. People say it all the time. Just because you apparently haven't heard it doesn't mean it's not happening, sorry. It's also hilarious that you're trying to patronise me for correcting poor language by saying I ""understand basic concepts"". Lazily mashing the words ""coffee"" and ""shop"" together because of how you say it is not a ""basic concept of language"", you utter moron.

iama,"As an adult, it's hard to say things like, ""oh my god you're my hero!""  But when I was a kid, you were definitely one of my heroes of the skateboarding world.  Going to the video store to rent comp tapes where you and Hasoi were battling out on the crazy ramps of the 80's was a real highlight of my childhood.
  
Now with that out of way, who was the skater in your early pro career that was your biggest personal competitor, not necessarily the person that would best you in comps, but the one who's tricks, style, flow pushed you to up your game?

Also, through the years, plenty of pro's have fallen pretty hard, Gator, Hasoi, Peters...  Is there any advice you have for younger skaters that are coming up to help them avoid similar fates?

Thanks for doing this!"
worldnews,"It's not that I haven't read or seen anything... I haven't seen evidence of it being shot down that's what I was looking for.

Other than that people mentioned twitter posts from the rebels talking about shooting down a plane, but that was already confirmed that they did shoot down a Ukrainian military cargo plane right before this happened. I also know that there are reports that there were missile trucks in the area for the weeks prior to this, but that is just circumstantial right now. I guess I shouldn't have asked seeing as the inflammatory response I got and the massive downvotes but I was trying to find something more than just twitter posts about it as evidence of it being shot down.

todayilearned,"&gt;total medals is a better measure of overall Olympic program success.

Debatable. China received 15 more gold medals than the USA, but 10 less overall. That means China showed more volatility than the USA (they were much more likely either to win the gold or not place at all than the USA). Regardless, if you use modern competitive weighting techniques (like attributing 5 points to a gold, 3 to a silver, and 1 to a bronze), China *just* edged out the USA with a ""score"" of 346 against the USA's 330. However, they don't do it that way so who ""won"" the 2008 Olympics is a matter of endless debate."
worldnews,"Maybe oppression isn't the best of terms but there's a whole slew of things going on right now between China and HK.

One thing you probably won't hear about in western media but according to the locals in Hong Kong is a reality, is how China is quietly indoctrinating the future generations of Hong Kong's youth to become more complacent and pro-China, through among other things, the tampering of the school curriculum of Hong Kong local schools (which is very much under the control of mainland China).

Yes it may sound tin-foil hattish, but it's actually something they've done time and time again in mainland China."
iama,"It's pretty much meh... I mean not so bad, but not so good either. But trust me, you don't wanna live there. Iranian ladies are really pretty. I like them.

worldnews,"If they created actual dresses for men it might work. Toga like robes, or kilts.  Or tunics.

The problem with average guy in a dress is that you get the ""drunken-rugby-player-in-drag"" effect: he's wearing a dress that is way too tight, way too small, isn't intended for his body shape, reveals all his body hair, etc etc. 

Obviously transgender women (mtf) can and do wear dresses elegantly.  But that's usually when they're passing as/living as woman, not as the sort of hybrid that a guy with a beard in a frock would essentially represent."
iama,"You don't have to be a grad student to be brilliant at computer programming.  My brother graduated with a CS degree and has been on the Core programming team for Windows 8 at Microsoft since he graduated from college.  He interned at Google at the HQ after his sophomore year, and then Microsoft after his junior year and decided he would work at Microsoft after he graduated.  He is not a grad student but was one of the top programmers at his university, also on the CyberDefense team and some other high level clubs for programming.  If this guy can teach effectively, or increases their effectiveness with his teaching, the guy you replied to could be right in terms of cyber-warfare."
science,"There is a window at 800-1200 nm where you can get much deeper penetration than at neighboring wavelengths, by about 10x. Still talking mms, but it helps. The dropoff is largely exponential so you can just add more power or sensitivity to make up for some of that. Raman has the benefit of very low background thanks to the exceptionally narrow spectral lines that it measures, which is a nice perk and makes it work better in these situations. 

Near IR lasers work just fine for Raman, but in fluorescence microscopy the best method is to use these wavelengths in a 2-photon regime to excite visible emission with better penetration. "

iama,"I have one, Christoph Waltz playing Col. Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds. As seen in [the Late show interview](http://youtu.be/pgQA8Ae515s?t=35s), Waltz disagrees with Letterman calling Landa evil. He talks more about it at the 6:20 mark, but I think Waltz was fed up with talking to Letterman at that point lol. Letterman was being very rude imo.  
  
(Spoiler maybe?) 
After looking at the movie from Landa's prospective, I have to agree with Waltz and say that Landa is not really evil. Throughout the movie Landa was just someone who prides himself for being the best detective. He never really chose a side nor cared if that side was right or wrong. Everything he did was for himself. Thus, at the end of the movie he saw an opportunity to be the hero in the history books and took it."
science,"In short, we really don't know.  So what they found was basically that the particulate in Asian pollution is causing clouds to form differently over the northern Pacific in the Winter.  Its increasing the distribution of heat int he atmosphere and the new cloud patterns in turn have slightly increased the amount of radiative forcing.  Increasing the forcing indicates a warming effect, but the fact that its regionally and temporally limited in scope basically says that we don't know what the global effects are."
iama,"Hey Tony, because of your video game I got introduced to skateboarding at a super young age, I had to give it up though after some serious injuries and then my dad losing his job and then not having health insurance just in case I broke a limb again I'd be fuct. I just want to know when you were young and getting injured did you ever think of the medical costs? Moreover, nowadays with low income kids, which I was, who pick up skateboarding and not having access to good health care.  
Also I'd like to add, when will we get another Tony Hawk game at the caliber of Underground? Also what is the mark you want to leave on this world? "
worldnews,"Good journalism is answering the stupid questions and laying the groundwork, it's like when you read an article and it explains everything to you like you're an idiot before getting to the latest developments.

I think it's something similar. Stop circlejerking about how much smarter you are then the average person, you aren't."
todayilearned,"4k at 24inches is 180ish ppi. 

In order to drive a 300ppi display at 24inches or higher you would need ridiculous resolutions not supported by graphics hardware. 

It's not because manufacturers don't want to. It's because it's unfeasible. 

There are 8k displays planned for medical imaging. But medical equipment costs thousands if not into hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

That is a sector they stand to make money not inventing entirely new consumer display technology for an incredible niche.

science,"In my case it was the opposite.  Didn't engage in much physical activity (no sports) in my younger years and ate terribly.  I'm a lot more active now and more careful with what I eat.  Still have a bit of a belly (not that anyone can tell when I have clothes on) compared to nothing when I was younger not doing anything eating junk.  Started TRT and that has made a difference too in slimming me down so low testosterone, which is more likely as you get older, has an impact on body fat\muscle composition.

I also know someone who worked as a personal trainer and ran their own circuit gym.  He worked very closely with woman of all ages.  He used to tell me that some post-menapausal women, despite putting them on his program and keeping careful watch, had a really hard time shedding pounds.

There are other factors going on besides diet\exercise as many will find out when they get older.

iama,"The true reason for the vast majority of the anti-GMO-movement is fear of the unknown (because they're simply ignorant of the biology) and appeal to nature fallacy. The ""patent issues"" are largely made up and/or exaggerated beyond recognition.

Of course they're entitled to make profit with their work. Silly question.

It costs a lot of money to deregulate GMO crops, all while copying plants is easy. There's got to be a way to monetize that research, otherwise nobody would do it.

Further, patents run out after a certain time and then the trait is in public domain. Works quite well so far."
worldnews,"&gt; Yes, but does it have to be brought up in every FGM thread?

Why shouldn't it?  There's a pretty huge double standard in the west when it comes to gender and circumcision.  Most redditors are from western countries where male circumcision is a hell of a lot more common yet hardly gets any attention when compared to FGM and people who get outraged at the idea of female circumcision will then run out and have their own boy's genitals mutilated.

Sorry, but it's not the female side of this issue that's being downplayed."

worldnews,"I said they don't get beaten up for not having shaved legs or armpits. 

Attacking somebody because they are gay is a bit different. 
Also, how many people would agree that it was ok, if there was a poll in UK about that?  
 
Should people be able to be openly gay?   
 
How many muslims do you think would answer no compared to non-muslim British?

iama,"It's interesting, because I come from a country with an inquisitorial system (France). The advice I received from lawyers here is straightforward, don't say a word (apart from your identity). The reason is, even you manage to see a lawyer during initial incarceration (police officers can detain anybody up to 24h, 72 hours in some cases), the lawyer has no access to the police file. At trial however he has access, which allows him to mount a defense. Basically saying nothing is almost always the best course of action because you are blind against the police.

You mention the judge accusing someone of changing the story, but if you never testified to anything and only spoke at trial you're not changing your story, you're giving it for the first time. I don't see how that can be turned into an argument against someone."
worldnews,"It's a misleading title. The question they posed to respondents is to ""choose the woman *most appropriately outfitted* for a public place"" not necessarily what they prefer. It's easy for someone's thought process to be ""well, 6 is okay...but 5 is a little more modest...and I guess more conservative people would be less offended with a 3 or a 4...I'll go with 4"" even though they find 6 to be perfectly acceptable to their own sensibilities.

TL;DR the survey doesn't ask people their preferences; it asks people what they perceive about others' preferences."
iama,"Not sure if you're still answering questions/responding to comments but, thank you for doing everything you've done. Without watching those instructional DVDs you made years ago (With Kris Marcovich and Koston, I've forgotten the name) I probably would have never learned what I did as a kid, or at least as well as I did. Now I'd like to think that I have good understanding of the basics (My friends all like my ollies a lot). Thanks for making those, landing those first tricks was the main reason my big interest in skating took off. I distinctly remember saying to not push mongo, so I didn't. With a lot of my friends pushing shit-foot I was one of the only ones that pushed regular for years. When Tony Hawk tells you not to push mongo, you don't push mongo."

For instance, I'm thinking of something like [Toxoplasma gondii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis). Part of me wonders if there is single virus or bacteria we haven't discovered that may be the underlying cause of some of these major neurological conditions. And one day, it will be discovered, treated, and instantly everything will make a lot more sense. 

Similarly, do you think bacteria in the gut could influence these diseases? Sorry if this is a stupid question or has an obvious answer.

askreddit,"I have a scar on my middle finger of my right hand. When I was just a wee lad, and my interest in cooking began to bloom. I grabbed my mothers 8 inch chef knife to open a box. While I was opening this box I was running around and talking like Sweedish Chef from the Muppets. I slipped and cut my middle finger open. Badly.

Now the next part was something I don't remember much. I remember Blood. **lots** of blood. I got a few stitches, and had a thing around my finger. 

The next day I told everyone in my daycare about how a man tried to come into my hone and I attacked him and scared him away, but not before he pulled out his knife and slashed at my finger.

I mean now I work at a fancy restaurant and I've yet to cut off any extremities, so I guess I got it out of my system as a child. 

TL;DR: Don't let your children watch The Muppets, while also having access to knives and an interest in the culinary arts."
iama,"The great part is that Gmail has been around long enough that a competitor could replace Gmail with a clone based on open source technologies (ie Elasticsearch). You may have to pay a bit (FastMail charges, but its cheap), but that's a great alternative to being forced over to Inbox when the time comes.

I believe the time is coming soon where email is still going to be an open protocol/standard, but MTAs are going to use REST APIs to exchange messages instead of SMTP/POP/IMAP, all of your email is going to be exportable as JSON, and you'll be able to easily import/export it as compressed bundles. I may just be crazy though. I just don't want the Gmail-&gt;Inbox migration to look like Google Chat-&gt;Hangouts (which is fucking terrible and a step backwards)."
science,"Not to say that those numbers can't be correct, but I am extremely hesitant to trust a website called Animal Aid Youth, and doesn't source any of its own data.

But lamb meat, as most people know, isn't slaughtered until the animal is 1 year old. Mutton is the adult sheep food, and that is 2 years old. So yes, some sheep may be slaughtered younger than 1 year, but the data from that website just glosses over all of that. "
iama,"We skated together, long ago. You brought your tour through Nashville, TN  I was skating this gap at xxx-sports skate shop and park.  I decided to jump a gap with some of the pros that day.  From a 12 vert pipe to a 6-7 foot wedge ramp.  I ended up doing a 450 degree spin of the gap, after 3 tries, and won skates and money.  You may not remember this, but this was huge for me.

Thanks for being cool and rooting me on in that moment, that is a great day of nostalgia for me.

I am sure you meet tons of kids and have seen so many variations of skate parks, but I just want to feel like this would be a medium to be able to thank you for the wee bit of investment you had in me that day."

That would require it being passed all the way from Latin America, where coca plants go, all the way through the continental US, through the ice cold Canada and Alaska, handed over to some Asian tribes, which would have to cross SIBERIA, give it to some central Asian nomadic tribes, who'd bring it to Mesopotamia, who'd give it to the Egyptians.

science,"They're roughly identical in their health effects. Fructose + glucose is fructose + glucose, as far as your body is concerned.

We could probably almost all do with eating less sugar of all kinds, but that's really irrelevant to the corn subsidy debate. The differences in price between HFCS and other cheap sugars like beet sugar are important on the manufacturing side, but they're pretty irrelevant on the consumer side; if the subsidies went away, farmers and manufacturers could switch to beets and most of us wouldn't even notice a price difference (assuming the subsidies were phased out slowly enough to avoid a sudden shock). The place where we'd really notice a big difference is in beef."

The main takeaway here should be that there are no ""switches"" we can flip to put a stop to climate change.  Geoengineering is covered in the other reply to you, but generally you can't fix a problem magnitudes greater in scale with a quick fix."
iama,"As a half Irish half Finnish individual that has experienced the drinking culture of both countries, I am genuinely surprised that Ireland comes out above Finland.

My experience has been that in Ireland people like to drink and do so often, but they don't get utterly shitfaced. In Finland they do. In Ireland it's more of a thing you do socially while in Finland drinking is nearly like a competition to see who can drink the most.

I can only assume that the difference is mostly due to frequency with the Irish doing it often but to a lesser degree"

todayilearned,"&gt; Legal or not heroin would still destroy lives and families, and that's not because people are robbing and killing for it. Long term heroin use destroys your body and mind, and it destroys your relationships.

That is no more true as a blanket statement than screaming anyone who uses alcohol would end up in the gutter.

I personally know functioning heroin addicts as well as people who use pharmaceuticals all day long - and they are good parents, hold down steady jobs and are not destroying anything other than their ability to freely exercise this habit without fear of going to jail.

The funny thing is, you probably know these people too - but they are never going to let you know about their secret.

&gt; That being said legalizing heroin may create more effective treatment programs.

This I completely agree with. At the same time, in many places where the stigma of heroin use is lesser than here people live their lives out quietly doing what they feel the need to do."

Why push for a substance that has deleterious effects on the development of the human brain?  I'm happy to cite well-respected scientific studies if you'd like, but it should already be relatively obvious to you should you understand the effects of marijuana.

I fully support the legalization of marijuana, but just as I believe alcohol should be restricted to those 21 and older, I also believe that marijuana should be as well *solely for the purpose of protecting brain development*.

todayilearned,"That's the thing about drugs in general though. Anyone can overindulge in drugs but that doesn't mean that the majority of people that do psychedelics over indulge in them. There are definitely the recreational trippers that trip every week but I also know plenty of trippers that only trip once a month, only a couple times year and even some that literally just tried it once and never did it again because they didn't feel a need to. Overall I'd say it's all about responsible use. 

In your case it is best to stay sober though. Some people can't have self control with certain drugs while others can. What specific drugs were you doing though? Our of curiosity more than anything you don't have to answer."
science,"While these likely raise valid points, it's extremely important for each individual nation to be capable of creating enough food for it's population in the event of a crisis that prevents it getting it from it's regular sources. All it takes is for a drought/disease/war and you'd start wishing you hadn't closed down all your native farms in preference of imports. 

Since western farmers often can't compete with the prices of farmers from developing nations they would naturally want to use their land for more profitable things or simply not work as farmers at all. The solution is to pay some farmers to continue growing unprofitable crops. [Famine is a horrible thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines), and such subsidies help minimize the risk of one occuring.

That said, I have no clue about the USA's farming subsidy system and perhaps it's subject to corruption."

Someone used Apple as an example, prime example of a monopoly and making use of what ever they can overseas to cut costs, even though they 'claim' they are saying they're bringing some of the jobs back to the US. Bottom line we're all responsible for the pollution there because it's only going to hurt all of us in the future even if the pollution appears at the moment to only be affecting China. Last note I am also guilty of purchasing items that are a product of the above but I see how it hurts the environment and I will be more aware of the products I'm purchasing as a step in the right direction.

iama,"Ok, I'd say the most complicated sounds for me to create are revolve around field recording. That's complication alone because you don't have much control over the outside world.

1. gun shots
2. earthquakes, tornadoes... destruction type sounds
3. Anything dealing with surround sound

**Gun shots:** depending on where I'm reading, it's a constant fight with natural ambiance and reverbs that are hard to control. I create them by setting up multiple mics and recording multiple takes.


**Sounds of destruction:** This is very tedious. For these types of sounds, you have to collect a lot of source material and start laying and building out the sound. All crashes, glass, rumbles etc have to be recorded separately and then layered. Lots of EQ has to be used to give each sound it's own space.

**Surround Sound:** I stay away from it. It's not something I understand or have the time to learn at the moment, but would love to in the future.

I am for needle exchange programs and safe places for junkies to shoot up. But the fact is some of the junkies don't give a crap where they leave their dirty needles and other people pay the price, sometimes with their lives.

todayilearned,"The problem with windows has nothing to do with ""making both the hardware and software"" but instead is due to backwards compatibility and leaving too much up to the applications. Apple has intentionally broken backwards compatibility several times on the way to OSX, allowing them to update old APIs, whereas the only major break I know from windows is that 16-bit applications don't work in 64-bit windows. 

It is possible to [create a DPI aware application](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms701681.aspx) in windows, which will scale perfectly well. But most applications aren't dpi-aware, and windows just stretches their image and makes them blurry. Why aren't most apps scalable? Because it takes extra effort, and most devices don't need it, so developers don't bother. Since developers don't bother, windows devices with Hi-DPI displays aren't as popular, and the cycle continues..."
worldnews,"Imagine for a moment you showed someone in the US the following pictures of a man dressed in:

* 1. Tuxedo with gloves and a tophat
* 2. Formal modern Tuxedo or black suit
* 3. Three piece Business suit
* 4. Jacket and Fedora
* 5. Polo Shirt and slacks
* 6. T-shirt and shorts
* 7. Pajamas

Then take a poll and ask the question ""Which person is most appropriately dressed for public""

I would expect that you would get a great deal of responses that the person in the Polo shirt and slacks was 'more appropriately dressed' than the person in the T-shirt.  You will probably find a significant portion would also select the 'jacket + fedora' as it looks somewhat 'put-together'.

So just because someone selected a hajib as 'most appropriate to wear in public', there could be a great deal of cultural fashion sense influencing the response.  Just as someone picking the Jacket+Fedora option might just be saying that such an outfit is the 'classical outside wear' for men.


"
todayilearned,"Bad analogy. Women in America have more access to education, get more education, and have a wider array of realistic job choices compared to men. In fields high paying where women are the minority, there are campaigns and political pressure on schools to train more women. Some schools even offer special classes only for girls to help boost STEM numbers.

There is zero pressure to get more men into nursing, education, HR, child care, or any other field where women dominate. It's a double standard, it's discrimination, and it's sexism. People should speak up about it."
science,"Hi Unidan! I posed the idea to my daughter who is in 3rd grade and wants to be a veterinarian.  She asks:

In the future, will penguins adapt to be able to fly? Will elephants change size and be smaller or larger? Will giraffes necks get shorter? Because we learned that penguins adapted flippers to swim to catch fish and elephants got bigger to scare lions and giraffes got long necks to eat from tall trees. Also, will cheetahs ever be slower? And why do boy lions have manes? And how much grass do you need to have a grassland? 

She then wanted to know if she set the world record for most questions.  She loves learning about adaptations and researches everything.  We both look forward to your reply. "
science,"Eh? Novel proteins from an agrobacterium using a bacteriophage as a vector [which can cause unpredictable mutations or truncations of the protein] aren't the same thing as splicing genes from other plants.

Pro-GM talking heads often try to pretend genetic engineering is a precise science whereby a specific gene is carefully inserted into a strand of DNA. This is not reality. Many plants are infected with an agrobacterium that causes tumors, then a vector virus carrying genetically engineered genes is used on the plants, and then they test the plants for the trait [because not all of the insertions are successful or fully successful]."
science,"Their goal is not to show the bioavailability or anything of that sort. The goal of the paper is to show an in vivo effect in the mouse model, which they do. Your criticism of pharmacokinetics is all fine and dandy, but is honestly geared toward translation of the molecule to other models and use as a therapeutic agent. The paper simply attempted to show that ingestion of this substance causes a statistically significant effect in vivo and in vitro. Your speculations on dosage and bioavailibility are fair criticisms for someone trying to make a drug, but I feel are ultimately irrelevant for a very preliminary result such as this."
worldnews,"No such thing as morality. It's just a conceptualization of your feelings and gut instincts which are partly a result of evolution, rearing, and how your society has also evolved. Essentially, nothing is wrong or right, but equally, you can just say fuck something because it feels wrong or repulses you. Whether, on the other hand, human beings in general are altruistic or otherwise is another question which can be answered by social sciences. However, whether something is wrong or right, after all the questioning and dilemmas have been explored, it just boils down to how you feel about it. Suddenly, things become so easy: dog eating, no; cow eating, eh ok; slavery, no; equal rights, sure; but why? Cuz I feel like that's right.

But that there was little doubt that the plane was struck by a surface-to-air missile, the official said.

science,"Alright, so if we're designing tests to prove whether someone has such-and-such tendency, isn't it the fault of the test if they are able to manipulate it? Should the manipulation not be measurable and be part of the test itself?

All I'm seeing is, ""people who we *feel* are psychopaths have been objectively measured to not be psychopaths.""

It's stuff like this that makes me feel like the whole study of psychopathy is a crock. The more I read about it, the more I'm convinced that psychopathy is diagnosed on ""gut"" feelings and has no real basis in scientific truth. It's false pattern recognition. If psychopathy was real, you would think someone would come up with a repeatable test to prove it."
worldnews,"There are definitely more secular cities than Istanbul, particularly the ones near the Aegean coast and the ones in Thrace. Istanbul is somewhere in between in terms of lifestyle of the country (also same for Ankara). So, I wouldn't say one was ""very"" biased if they only visited Istanbul. 

Also, it is not only that Turkey is becoming more religious and conservative. The bigger problem is polarization. Conservatives get more conservative, while the other side gets more radical and maybe less considerate."

Generic Augmentin without insurance is $48. A generic z-pak without insurance is $36. There's a shortage of doxycycline on the market so I've seen patients charged upwards of $200 without insurance for that one. Cipro/Levofloxacin? Forget about it. Some forms of regular amoxicillin and bactrim are super cheap, but depending on the type of bacteria those might not be the appropriate antibiotic. For some people that kind of money is a big deal."

2.)  How rigid were the race lines?  Is it true that if when you show up and don't fall in with your race you're basically screwed?   If not, we're there people who didn't join any racial group and kind of flew solo?  And lastly, we're there any (in lack of a better term) 'defectors' that fell in with other races and were actually accepted by them?"

In terms of this comment, I highly doubt that a great deal of the world knows about Portugal's cuisine.

I only said that Portugal tries to follow what Spain does because of its geographical location. It just seems like the little brother on the side of Spain. I don't know anything about the social and economical policies of Portugal. I mean, why would I?

If you really wanted me to try out Portuguese cuisine, you don't have to get confrontational about it. Just say 'have you tried some Portuguese dishes? This particular one is amazing.' That would get me interested, not some rant about how I don't know shit."

science,"This is a common trope, but it gets the history backwards. Group selection came first,  kin selection was proposed as an alternative to group selection, but turned out to be merely an alternative description. This meant that the main message of group selection--that traits can evolve when they are ""for the good of the group"" can be accepted at face value. See Oren Harman's book ""The Price of Altruism"" or Hamilton's own account in ""The Narrow Roads of Geneland"" for more. 

In addition, although simple models of group and kin selection are inter-translatable, other models are not. Selection among alternative locally stable equilibria, which are readily understood in terms of multi-level selection, are hard to understand in terms of kin selection. So also are cases of cultural group selection that take place over centuries.

Canada, while geographically large still has a small town mentality from coast to coast.   That level of security that you guys face everyday is a foreign concept to most of us. "
science,"I'm not i understand, isn't the criteria for success the ability to reproduce evolutionary speaking, so surely if a trait was developed by chance that enabled an individual to be significantly stronger than his rivals and this in turn resulted in greater reproductive success, would this not follow that this would then ultimately spread across the species?

i..e under a system of ""winner takes all"" where one alpha man sires multiple offspring at the expense of the genetic mix of ""lesser"" males, does this not result in a stronger overall population over enough generations?

could the case be made that the difference between males and females in humans, is that genetically the males have higher competition and thus more likely to significantly change and adapt to the increased selective pressure, over a female?

It seems its almost a mathematical certainty to me, linked purely by the mechanics of reproduction?"

iama,"Sorry for not staying in to comment reply. The United States has blocked research due to the schedule 1 status. Not so in other countries.

There is plenty of room for Western style pills like Marinol and whatever else comes after it. The medical co-op will be gone inside of 10 years is my prediction. There will be recreational stores like that but as it becomes legal and regulated it will become more of a liquor store type deal and uniform packaging, labeling, and dosing will clean the whole thing up. Next step will be pharma and RJ Reynolds taking over. "

I was there for him for support as he was to the point of attempting to amputate his leg himself at home or suicide.  Luckily I talked him out of those things.  He has since found a doctor that has helped him complete his desire and his BIID symptoms have completely vanished.  In researching BIID and similar disorders (which I believe to suffer from myself) there has been no cure as it research has found it doesn't stem from a psychological but a neurological disorder.

science,"So what you're saying is we shouldn't do it because maybe there will be problems even though current rigorous bouts of testing show there is none? This is the same thing that happened to nuclear energy and it worries me. Nuclear was by far the best option to replace fossil fuels and was completely safe if done right, but people were afraid of potential risks so now we never talk about it anymore. GMOs could solve world hunger, but maybe there's a tiny chance that something could go wrong, so why bother? Hell, burning fossil fuels has had bad side effects but it propelled us into the modern era, should we have never used those either? Science and progress are about taking risks and fixing your mistakes. We as a society can't be paralyzed by fear of potential outcomes, especially if the probability of them is minute. If we never took risks we'd still be in the dark ages."

If she did not have autism, she would not be the same person.

I can't imagine a situation where a company might sue another company which in turn sues itself. 

Sony (and companies similar) have had conflicting goals though. Sony Music creates music content, but they also are in consumer electronics so they sold CD burners. RIAA was extremely against CD burners because they ""cause piracy"". So Sony as a whole had two areas of it's company kind of ""against"" each other.

I would love to see if you could find it, but you probably won't. All the layoffs in newsrooms that I've read about/heard about are attributed to restructuring, lower advertising revenue, the digital transition, and contract-related issues. Never heard of APs/bookers/line producers getting laid off because of ""bad ratings."""
iama,"So the best thing you can do is manipulate the fuel point system. during the summer and frequently throughout the kroger does double the fuel points, then around holidays they will offer 4x fuel points on gift cards.

I did these when I was doing home renovations and bought HomeDepot gift cards and got so much cheap gas.

iama,"You know what Larry, I remember sitting on my father's lap when I was just an infant, and he would be watching your show and I would just stare at the fancy lights in the background. My dad always told me you were a great guy, especially compared to other people on TV, and I have always respected you. Even now, as I have grown up and become educated and developed my own opinions on things, I can say I have always respected you.

But one thing I can't respect, is you doing something as outrageous as saying  ***CORNED BEEF*** would make a better pair of suspenders than pastrami. There's just no way."
worldnews,"yeah, there is no evidence of fowl play. None what so ever. It's more likely a plane just crashed over an extremely volatile area where numerous air crafts have already been shot down. You say, "" I must also mention that we are about to enter into the 6 weeks leading up to September 11th, 2014"" then say, "" Instead draw your own conclusions based upon adequate intellectual process and evidence and proof."". So the logical conclusion is the US is involved because it's 6 weeks away from the 13th anniversary of Sept. 11. Do you know what I am saying? "
science,"So what exactly should we be concerned about? You say there are issues, but don't list any.

And I think you're missing the point about ""nothing about GM is exceptional or even different on a molecular level."" Take for instance a GM tomato fortified with nutrients. Can you eat a tomato and be fine? Yes. Can you eat the nutrients in there alone and be fine? Yes. So why would combining them together have any deleterious health effects? 

This fear of GMOs just strikes me as coming from the same type of people who thought microwaves were going to cause cancer when we first invented those. It comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of genetics. Just because we put a gene into an organism doesn't mean its going to jump into your genome. We aren't made of entirely HEK293 cells, it doesn't work like that. I think it essentially boils down to ""I don't understand GMOs, so I am afraid of them."""
iama,"Hey Dude.
Perhaps you have already heard this song we recorded. In any case, I was a big LOST fan and heard only the 20-30 seconds you and Liam played in Season 2. I searched everywhere for the real song and when I finally came to the conclusion that it was simply a ""for tv written"" song... My singer Frost and I from The Bangkok Five took it upon ourselves to write the rest of the song- music and lyrics.  I initially made a tribute video but we have since re-recorded the song and made a lyric video to go along with it.  Hope you enjoy.  Thanks for the inspiration.

iama,"My body produces far too much bile sometimes which causes me to feel pain, vomit, and/or have it come out the bottom end in copious amounts. If I eat too quickly, drink too much liquid, or randomly happen to eat something that doesn't agree with me I can have something happen to me called ""dumping syndrome"" where my GI tract goes into super overdrive and moves much too quickly. This causes dizziness, breaking out into a clammy sweat, disorientation, pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and heart palpitations. "
todayilearned,"wow so many things I disagree with. But first:

Genesis 2:17--

But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.


Thats definitely a command, and of course they had a choice in whether to follow it or not. Thats what shows Gods love for man, his gift of life and the freedom to choose.  

Original Sin is very much real and why we need Baptism to wash it away. Afterwards as we get older and commit more sins of our own, we can receive forgiveness through confession"
worldnews,"The analogy is irrelevant. If the majority of Indians could afford the cost of the pills or if the government could afford to subsidize them for all indians and that creating them by stealing patents cuts into the profits of the companies responsible for the research then there is an argument that what India is doing is unacceptable. But the situation is the complete opposite.

Also like most people are saying the development of drugs is rather inexpensive compared to what it takes pharmaceutical companies to get them cleared and out into the market. The actual development of new drugs will never lose its demand and a lot of times it isn't the big pharma companies that develop them, they just buy the rights to them."
worldnews,"&gt;The civil war in Syria happened as a conseguence of the arab spring

No, here is why it happened:

&gt;""As I went back through the Pentagon in **November 2001**, one of the senior military staff officers had time for a chat. Yes, we were still on track for going against Iraq, he said. But there was more. This was being discussed as part of a five-year campaign plan, he said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, **then Syria**, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran.""

&gt;he could have won by simply letting the Islamic State occupy the whole syrian territory

Bahaha.... bullshit. Assad was kicking their ass long before the US decided that supporting Islamists who behead people was not such a good idea.

That's why they decided to invade Iraq instead."
worldnews,"What world power hasn't?  The truth is the US is the cleanest in a long line of horrible regimes who abused their strength.  

Do you realize the casualties the us took taking small islands like Iwo Jima where they sure as hell did fight to the last man.  

Taking the mainland would have been an absolute nightmare.  And even after the bomb was dropped there were still radicals in Japan that tried to seize power so they could fight to the death.  
You weren't around then.  You weren't in line to go fight over there.  I imagine if you were you wouldn't be complaining about the method used to stop a demented and horrible regime. "
todayilearned,"I was watching **every single movie** that came from Hollywood during that time (2006-2007). I knew the buzz about these to movies, but i got to see NCFOM first and loved it instantly. I then had to see TWBB, and I knew it would be a tough competitor for NCFOM, but I told myself no film would get nowhere near NCFOM. So when I saw TWBB I had build up an odd kind of rivalry between these to films, anyhow I just couldn't hate TWBB, such a classic.

But No Country for Old Men is still my all time favorite  "

The OP said that the teenagers create a disturbance ""until the wee hours.""  From that, we can infer that the OP is being robbed of sleep -- sleep that an adult needs in order to function and lead a productive life.

Not that no one has a valid complaint about such noise even when it occurs earlier in the evening or during the daytime, of course.

iama,"I know this isn't a question or even reflective on what kind of a person you are, but I did see you once. I was at the opening game at Petco Stadium where you and a bunch of other pros were as they put up a half pipe. Every other person there made a point to say hello to the crowd and even sign things for them. I don't remember you ever signing something for anyone, or even acknowledging our existence. It really crushed the kid I was at the time as I looked up to you as a role model. I'm just curious if there was a reason for that behavior that day. "
science,"His point was something along the lines of....say someone at age 15 broke their knee.  It hurts right now but after a year of healing up, it's back to normal.  But as the years go on and that person gets older and older, their knee hurts more than the other in the winter and it gives them problems for the rest of their life.  

A year or two later it seems like it's perfect but there was actually more damage done to it than could be viewed in a few years, you had to look at the after effects of dozens of years later to really see the true damage.  

But if that 15 year old died of...a car crash at age 25, you'd never know that knee would give them those problems down the line. 

Yeah I'm sure there's holes in the analogy but that was more of what he meant than the meaning you pulled from it.  "
iama,"I think the key is to develop expertise that is needed in the development industry without necessarily first developing it in a development context. There is a huge need for health workers, accountants, logistics managers - depending on the sector, lots of other examples. If you develop those kinds of skills, you will be able to make yourself useful in development and find demand for your services.

What low income countries have is lots of unemployed labour - so despite all the volunteering schemes that do this, going out to build something is quite unhelpful. It just takes work away from construction workers. What they lack is skills, which they need people both to practice and to teach. "

There’s lot of fun moments actually. Under a mask no one can hear you. There’s a part where I turn to an Imperial officer and say, “Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold,” but I actually said “Put Captain Cargo in the Solo hold.” Luckily I didn’t have to tell anybody because you can’t hear what I’m saying under the mask.

science,"Um. I've lived in a different country than my fiance of 5 years for 4 of them. So, hard, yes. But he will be moving to the US in a few months and we couldn't be more in love with each other which is made easier by something directly related, as a matter of fact, haha... Well, I know you'll call this pseudo science but we are able to send each other information and powerful emotions telepathically. That's not something you can understand and would likely not believe if you aren't among the few people who have developed it,  but it's what most proves to me that our universe and conscious cannot be defined that easily, though some small reflections of the truth can be seen. Also, although I am not athiest, I never said anything about speaking to a diety. "
worldnews,"Probably because it's not relevant. This words were not taken out of context

It's in the article with a link to the [twit](https://twitter.com/pieterbroertjes/status/491872935519727616). Saying something you don't think out of frustration isn't the same as ""taken out of context to make something innocuous seem horrible"".

science,"To piggy back onto this, it's a very daunting task to have the gene eliminated due to the way the genes spread between bacteria. They can actually send pieces of their genome to one another, so as long as 1 bacteria in the population has the pump/wall/whatever gene that gives it immunity reintroducing the antibiotic will pressure the bacteria to ""re-spread"" that gene.

As an aside, methicillin isnt actually used on people it's purely a lab chemical now that is used as a marker for that class of anti-biotics"

As a GFOP I am extremely happy to see how well you two have been received over the past month, continued success.

Two questions:

1) For Rog: Do you think Jurgen feels personal satisfaction in his influence on the German National Team and their current success? And how do you think the current German success can lead to future American success?

2) For Davo: Previous to this past EPL season, it seemed like there was an insinuation of a possible MiB show somewhere. Do you feel with your current success during the World Cup, you two might re-visit that possibility again or that ESPN would be more open to that idea?"

I've been to a number of civilian demonstrations in that area in support of the FSA, encouraging them to win the battle against ISIS and Assad.

I can also say that, in the town I visited, the situation changed completely when ISIS left...people started talking again. While ISIS was there, people were terrified.

The civilians I met were happy to see ISIS driven out of the town.

In front of the whole cast and crew I jumped up and said...'so you just jump off, roll and run off'...I made it look super easy and then whispered...your turn tough guy!

iama,"Aaaaand I'm going to be over here, fielding this softball. :) 

It's actually kind of tough to identify ONE favorite, but over the years I've spent as a journalist, I think my favorite KINDS of stories have been the ones where I've gotten to interview incredibly unique people, or people who just represent a different point of view. Like, once I interviewed a woman with cataplexy - this really interesting subset of narcolepsy. People who have it literally collapse when they experience some overwhelming emotion -- this woman collapsed whenever she laughed too hard! I'd find the link but who has the time; it was a story years ago for NBC. More recently, I loved writing a story last year about anorexic teenagers whose eating disorders were overlooked because they were also overweight or obese. I still keep in touch with one of the girls I interviewed for that story. Blah blah blah - basically, I love that I get to talk to fascinating people, for my job! -- MD"
iama,"Honestly, it's the people. There is such a degree of ""taking care of me"" mentality it kind of hurts when you're programmes to go so far for someone else and yet they just kinda blow you off because having a kid can be inconvenient. I let go of the whole ""early to rise"" mentality pretty quickly. It's just the laced willpower and personal accountability I hate. 

And now, my daughter is with my parents. My dad works I, Texas and my mom in Michigan. He's home for the holidays and has probably only spent about 12 days with his grand daughter in 7 months. So when they asked to take her for the day I didn't hesitate. More so that my wife works today and so the duty of black Friday shopping fell on me alone last night and I slept for about 14 minutes."

worldnews,"&gt; As there had been no threats from the Eastern Ukrainians to actually shoot down any airliners, it's business as usual - until now.

There are many more issues to be discussed before we continue to recklessly experiment with novel genetic codes in the field.

science,"To view survival in the context of the individual only is overly reductionist. One must view it in the context of the species. Evolution does not care for an individual, as any ant can tell you, most of those never reproduce at all. 

The gene that when active in males increases chances of homosexuality when active in females increases fertility. Mathematically it aids survival if females are more fertile at a cost of non-reproducing males. Furthermore, in nature we see that homosexual males of social mammals invariably aid the group as a whole and the children of their siblings in particular. So it is an evolutionary double-whammy in favour of survival. There are more children, which are better cared for."

It's just a point to counter the guy's claim that classmates can and will do all the girls' work for them through school.

iama,"It was multiple things, the Tea Party always seemed to be on the wrong side of the issue and if there is one thing that I learned that united all Tea Partiers, it was the concept of ""fact-free"". I noticed a lot of people just bought everything they heard if it didn't conflict with their beliefs and it was what they wanted to hear.
So many people in the Tea Party are still concerned with the birth certificate issue, Benghazi, and Bill Ayers, that I'm not sure if they realize what the real issues are.

science,"Hello! I am an 18 year old college student and I was diagnosed with EBV about 6 months ago. I have been taking homeopathic series therapy vials to rid my body of the virus but I fear that it still lurks inside me. I have been ill for the last year with many stomach and intestinal issues that have caused me to lose almost 90 pounds without much exercise.

I apologize if I may be writing this to the wrong person or if my efforts may be in vain, but just this morning, I discovered a very painful lump on my left side under my rib cage and I do not want to jump to any conclusions, cancer is definitely something on my mind. How worried should I be about my health and should I seek immediate medical attention? Thank you for reading this and best of luck on your project!

iama,"Yeah, we don't keep olives in the brine. We strain it out and store the drained olives in those plastic containers (we call them bams). It COULD be that they're not kept in that, but I don't really know. I hate olives and never eat them, so I have nothing to compare Subway's olives to. Maybe the store by you just doesn't make sure they're fresh? 

And yes, the strange and unique smell that clings to your clothes is caused by the bread rising in the proofer before it bakes, particularly the Italian herb and cheese bread. If you're ever in a store when they're baking bread, you'll probably notice that the smell gets stronger when the proofer door is open. Also, after bread is done baking and the oven door is opened, a big cloud of steam usually billows out. That cloud just spreads out and gets all over everything.

Some people LOVE the ""Subway smell,"" but I hate it. I can never go out anywhere after work because I need to go home and shower first. =/"

iama,"What health and/or safety aspect are you referring to?

There is zero evidence of harm from GMO. There is no nutritional difference between GMO and non-GMO. There is no allergen risk. There is no ethical concern. 

Labelling is,at best, an innocuous lifestyle choice that doesn't warrant a law being passed to support (it is as helpful to the average consumer as a label identifying that food has been handled by gay folks). At worst (and most likely IMO) it is seen as a first step in completely banning GMO. "

is informed by the history of our coverage --James Baldwin in 1966 wrote a remarkable dispatch, ""A Report from Occupied Territory"" (it was about Harlem) and we understood the trajectory and link between Baldwin's work and our racial justice issues. History can be a burden but also give us perspective --find hope and inspiration and ideas that nourish our minds and spirits through dark periods of our history, and also positioned The Nation to seize those moments when the country opens again, as I believe it is now, to progressive possibilities."
iama,"My pleasure - and based on your username, you may be interested in learning some about the lighting used in horticulture.  I'm very into the relationship between light and biology.  My aim is to bring 'human-centric lighting' to schools, prisons, and hospitals.  This is lighting that changes its color as the day goes on to match the outdoor conditions (more orange in morning and evening, brighter white in noon) which helps our circadian rhythms.  There are a lot of LED products out there which mention being 5-band, 7-band, 11-band, and full spectrum - lots of interesting stuff going on with light and plants, and equally interesting (but much less discussed) things going on with light and humans."
science,"It can definitely be a step in the monoculture direction as it seems like one single company aims at being a farmers supplier for all the resources (seeds, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, fertilizer, machinery etc) and the easier a system gets, the easier it is to control. Monocultures obviously can cause problems (imagine the same plant has the exact same demand for nutrients year after year - sure you fertilize, but some fertilizers are still limited until a more sophisticated solution somes around). Even GM plants are cracked by pests after a while, as nature is still a master of adaption. Your concern, however, can indeed be true for certain regions where only one GM crop is used and - let it be a special bug - has adapted and eliminates the whole harvest for one year."

science,"Not exactly true. They use the term ""virological penicillin"" due to it being the first antiviral isolated from a plant species, much as penicillin was isolated from a type of mold. Also, whereas penicillin is a class of small molecule drugs that inhibit peptidoglycan cross-linking in bacterial cell walls, this stuff is a microRNA known as MIR2911 that binds to a specific conserved sequence in influenza A viruses and activates the RNA silencing pathways of the host cell.

Basically, it's only effective against influenza A viruses, which is neat, but it's hardly the broad-spectrum drug that penicillin is."
science,"Actually Monsanto does force farmers to buy seed if their crops are raised anywhere near ones that have the modified gene that makes them Round Up ready.  They do this by suing farmers who try to keep their own seed stock for next year's crop, citing the fact that these seeds are the product of normal plants cross fertilizing with GMOs thus carrying this patented DNA.  Check out the documentary Food Inc.  It provides a really good look at this questionable legal practice while also exploring the vulnerability of our food supply chain now that fewer companies are producing it."

worldnews,"People were critical of Syria because the people Obama wanted to support were literally worse than the Assad regime - they're islamic fundamentalists with extremely strong ties to AQI.  Supporting them is very literally supporting AQI and putting AQI in a position of power.

The secular/reasonable rebels have been sidelined by the extremists, and nothing good can come from supporting the rebels.  There's literally no 'good side' in the Syrian war and no way America getting involved could provide a positive outcome.

These studies make no claims about homosexual transmission -- they were aimed at areas with high rates of heterosexual transmission. Their conclusions are consistent with each other and have held up to be confirmed in follow up studies of the trial populations.

However, epidemiological studies in other countries, including the United States, do show a protective effect of circ against a variety of STIs. Now, there are other ways to protect oneself against STIs, such as condoms, limiting your number of sexual partners, etc.

The protective effect of circ against UTIs in infancy is probably only most helpful for those boys who have kidney issues and who are prone to such infections."
worldnews,"It's pretty obvious that the buck isn't going to stop in Crimea.  There was never any violence there, and there isn't any now.  Putin isn't an idiot - he isn't actually occupying Crimea because he incorrectly thinks Russians are being forcefully ""deflagged"", he is occupying Crimea because it is a strategic port, and his left flank if he were to invade across the eastern border.  This is really the only thing that makes sense to me at this point.  You either have to go with the assumption that Putin is completely misinformed about the situation, or that he has something else in mind.  Protecting Russians doesn't require assaulting sovereign military bases.  Neither does ""securing"" their port in Sevastopol for peaceful purposes.  Securing a strategic staging area for a larger incursion, on the other hand, would absolutely require Putin to eliminate all Ukraine military presence in Crimea.  "

iama,"I don't necessarily plan for ""worst case scenarios."" We discuss and plan for ALL scenarios and rate the likelihood and consequence of the risk occurring. 

We look at the inherent risk, then the residual risk, then we discuss the current control mechanism and effectiveness of the control mechanism. This gives us a residual risk rating and anything from High, Very High, Or Extreme we work on putting better controls in place.

Very similar to this concept, but with our own spin: http://www.fishnetsecurity.com/sites/default/files/Blogs/inherit-and-residual-risk.jpg

iama,"Enormously. I'm very proud of my 60-page chapter on that transition--I'm convinced it's the first to really get at the transformation in a satisfying way. It's important for understanding the continuities in his life--always seeking out a heroic narrative of good versus evil; whether he was on the left or on the right, that remained constant. But also the changes, because without someone like Reagan begging able to slot right-wing ideology into an affirmative, optimistic view of the universe, it would have been much less attractive as a mass movement.

Also important because it made him more rhetorically persuasive, trustworthy: I was there, I saw how liberalism ""didn't work,"" how it seduces the young, etc.

iama,"Hockey is managed between the players most of the time. If a dirty player is going after a team's superstar player, that team will send one of their best fighters after the other team's dirty player.

It sends a message that you shouldn't mess with our best player and take cheap shots at him.

Also, fighting has an honor code. Much like golf's honor code (except golf has no violence). Once a player goes down, the fight's over. You can be losing the fight for 2 minutes and getting your ass kicked, but if your opponent falls to the ice, you stop fighting. 

It may seem brutal and barbaric, but it's regulated internally through the players. All of the players know the code and they all follow it. That's why you very rarely see 5 or 10 game suspensions from fighting in the NHL because there is no need for it."
worldnews,"Definitely varies per sect. Go on wikipedia or something and read all about Islam, it's such an interesting religion with a CRAZY history. I had a course called ""Modern Middle East"" in high school and in it we learned all about Islam, because my teacher made sure we understood the culture (it is both a religion and culture) before we tried to understand the situations in all the Middle Eastern countries right now. To hopefully tempt you, if you've ever played Assassin's Creed, then you should know that the sect in the first game is pretty accurately modeled after a real subdivision of Shi'a Islam. Yeah. They were actually called the Assassins, and they did crazy shit. But dude, seriously, they're not even the coolest part of that religion. There was some serious Game of Thrones shit that happened back in the beginnings. 
I've rambled a lot, but hopefully you get this and follow up on it.  "
worldnews,"Do you know why the Eastern Front was so brutal? It's actually really interesting.

In the 19th Century, Germany and (Imperial) Russia were signatories of the Geneva Conventions. However, when Lenin came to power in 1917 he voided all previous treaties as being ""Czarist"". From that date onward, the Soviet Union preferred to make singular agreements with its belligerents prior to hostilities. In 1941, when the Germans turned on their former Soviet ""allies"" (for the invasion of Poland), Hitler was so self-assured of Fall Barbarossa's success, that he never signed the one-on-one treaty. As such, neither side abided by the Hague Conventions...which is part of the reason the Eastern Front was so devastating."

worldnews,"it's like the men are victims of genital mutilation and want to be acknowledged for it, but for some reason people refuse to even claim that it is a problem. 

Remember how it was once legal to rape your wife? It would be like someone back then complaining they were raped. People would just look at her and say, ""you are married, he can't rape you, and you claiming rape is just hurting real rape victims"". Thankfully today we do consider rape inside of marriage to be rape. 

But imagine you were a woman during that time, because that is how many men feel today. You, on the other hand, are like the people of yesterday, claiming that it isn't on the same level, therefore we shouldn't address it.  "
worldnews,"There's a big difference between people self-identifying as ""religious"" (even if they're not particularly devout) and a government saying ""Everyone is Muslim unless they put in the effort, time, and money to change their registration -- unless they're a group of people we don't recognize, in which case we'll just say they're Muslim no matter what.""

Saying ""Turkey is overwhelmingly Muslim"" in this context means something very different than ""There are probably more irreligious people in the United States than we think."" "
todayilearned,"Here is a link to the relevant section of the Wikipedia article: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinner#History_and_etymology

&gt; Originally, *dinner* referred to the first meal of a two-meal day, a heavy meal occurring about noon, which broke the night's fast in the new day. The word is from the Old French (ca 1300) *disner*, meaning ""breakfast"", from the stem of Gallo-Romance *desjunare* (""to break one's fast""), from Latin *dis-* (""undo"") + Late Latin *ieiunare* (""to fast""), from Latin *ieiunus* (""fasting, hungry""). The Romanian word ""dejun"" and the French ""déjeuner"" retain this etymology and to some extent the meaning (whereas the Spanish word ""desayuno"" and Portuguese ""desjejum"" are related but are exclusively used for breakfast). Eventually, the term shifted to referring to the heavy main meal of the day, even if it had been preceded by a breakfast meal (or even both breakfast and lunch)."

askreddit,"Oh lord.  I hated interpreting for a sorority.  Too much bitchy in one room.  Had a great time interpreting for a frat, but was the wrong gender to join.

askreddit,"It really was. I just read it last month expecting to slug through the backstory of Middle Earth. I wanted to understand the Gondor Tree, the wizards, where hobbits came from, etc. It is not that. It's a completely parallel loosely connected series of stories that only overlap with a handful of characters. It's not the read you'd expect it to be.

The two stories at the beginning of the Silmarillion and the two at the end are very good. They tell way more between the 4 than the whole Silmarillion does. If you're hunting for backstory, read those. "
science,I would theorize it has something to do with the fact that new Mother's are often faced with a lot of pressure to slim back down immediately following the birth. (Not that there is anything wrong with losing weight or getting healthier that's awesome!) But society tends to have these obvious expectations for women weight wise that is not as structured as strongly towards a male. Dad's that are over weight is more socially acceptable that mom's that are. But that's just a theory for a young childless and unmarried redditor.

worldnews,"Here's the problem. 

1. China's economy is crashing right now. Home prices are falling heavily.Iron ore prices are dropping quickly.Oil prices are dropping. Which clearly indicates that China is headed downward quickly and this is largely due to the american's changed bond policy. Which means interest rates will rise and there will be interest rate shock. China isn't doing well and there may be an asian recession coming. 

2. China's development is leading it to a point where it will be too expensive and it will lose it's cheap manufacturing and thusly lose what is making itself strong.

3. They don't have a proper foundation to smoothly transition to chinese control. At best they'll be able to do is join us with better development. "
science,"&gt; Followup question: Would something like hemp be a comparable or better option for many of the things we use corn for? I.e. Feeding cows or making fuel.

I wouldn't think so. Hemp is probably a little more energy-dense than regular grass and clover, but I wouldn't expect it to get close to corn in terms of available bulk nutrition/energy. Hemp is industrially useful because it is a fibrous plant, which would translate to having more indigestible material that provides little energy and slows down the absorption of nutrients."
todayilearned,"Well that last part certainly has not been my experience, but it really depends on the situation so I'm sure it's probably true overall. By no means do I think that all guys just want sex of course, and you're right that it's actually similarly frustrating if they all want to date you. I just said (or at least meant to say) that it could likely be uncomfortable if several guys offer to help and expect a result that is beyond platonic.

worldnews,"&gt;To address this problem, instead of improving primary and secondary education, the government established the Bolivarian University system in 2003, which was designed to democratize access to ""higher education"" by **offering heavily politicised study programmes to the public with only minimal entrance requirements.**

iama,"Oh, I think both. I mean, you’ve got to say Star Wars. But I enjoyed the Bond films (I did three, two as Smithers). t was a great franchise to be involved with. Another one was Dr. Who. I’ve loved these shows, they’ve done very well and I’ve been cast in eight of them. My first love is theater, but if you can combine that with Dr. Who, Robin of Sherwood, and of course the Bonds, and the biggest of all, Star Wars, that would be my ideal. My grandchildren still like Harry Potter better than Star Wars. I’m trying to change their minds. "
science,"They both seem to have evolved from non-flying animals, though there's evidence suggesting that they did not evolve from the *same* non-flying animals, meaning that smaller bats and flying foxes both have evolved independently from differing animals in similar situations.

I suppose a close living relative to bats would be something like a colugo.  These are insectivorous animals that do quite a lot of leaping to catch prey!  It's theorized that this eventually became webbing to allow gliding, which eventually became flying as staying off the ground can be a safe way to avoid predation."
worldnews,"&gt;The racial distribution of arrestees for rape is similar to the racial distribution for all violent UCR arrests--56% of arrestees for rape in 1995 were white, **42% were black**, and 2% were of other races.

A group defines what they want action to be and then times it.  My definition of action can be very different than this other groups.

Football is a turned based sport and for real football fans the setting up of formations and motion are all part of the action.

If we get to make up our own definitions of what action is I am going to make up my own definition for soccer.  So here is my definition for action in soccer.  Action can only be defined as making a shot on goal or being actively contested for control of the ball.  Just dribbling down the field would not qualify.  So how much action in a soccer game?

If you do not like a sport, do not watch it.  I have no problems with anyone loving any sport.   Enjoy your life.

The poster is in fact mistaken, if they are referring to a link between the inert ingredients in Roundup and Parkinson's. No study has shown any relationship between these.

The studies done on the relation between pesticides and Parkinson's did not include Roundup. They were done on benomyl, paraquat and retenone. Of course these have all been shown to have potential or demonstrated health risks. Glyphosate has not."

Not at all. It's *because wishing to do harm on someone* as anything but *a means to an end* has, historically, been an amazingly effective tool for the sociopathic powers-that-be to sneak their shady shit past us.

If we could somehow avoid it, we'd lose nothing of long-term value, and close a serious chink in our metaphorical armour.

Seriously, think about it: The CIA hasn't kept it completely quiet, and have only been able to get away with it *at all* because the general populace thinks ""fuck those terrorists, let's torture the fuckers"".

iama,"And if we were still in the musket/bolt action phase I suppose you'd be screaming about how bolt action rifles are death machines because of how fast they fire. Even if Lanza had been using a break action double barrel .410 shotgun he would have killed those kids. He had 6 fucking minutes to slaughter. He fired less than 60 shots over 6 minutes. 10 shots a minute is NOTHING for a bolt action rifle.

More people are beaten to death in America with fists and foot than all rifles combined.
There are an estimated 475 MILLION rifles in America. Even if EVERY killing was done with a separate gun, that would put roughly (30,000 (including cops killing bad guys etc) divided by 400,000,000) .000075% of guns used to kill people.

iama,"A weight will probably conserve about 80% of its kinetic energy on the first bounce*. Therefore it would bounce to a height of 8 feet, since all of the kinetic energy would get transformed into gravitational potential energy, which scales linearly with height.

Mass of the weight is irrelevant. Counter-intuitively, gravity is also irrelevant: if it would bounce 8 feet on Earth, it would bounce 8 feet on the Moon, too. It would take quite a bit longer to fall onto the trampoline and bounce back up on the Moon, but it wouldn't bounce any higher.

iama,"I am well aware of that theory, but I don't subscribe to it. However, the theory demonstrates one of the basic challenges that faces parents of children with mental illness. Even within the medical community, there is stigma about some diagnoses, and with mental health in particular, we continue to rely on symptom reporting. This is why my son's nine-year path to the correct diagnosis that actually alleviated his symptoms is so common. Stigma prevents people from seeking help in the first place, and when they do seek help, it can take years to find the right combination of treatments. People get frustrated by the journey, and the medication often has terrible side effects, leading to noncompliance and relapse. Dr. Insel, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, highlighted all of these problems in his address to NAMI last week (wish I could have been there, but followed minute by minute tweets of his slide show).

They were happy trigger finger and just shot a big AA rocket blindly in the air, while knowing that multiple passengers jets were in the same airspace."
worldnews,"Yes, now try telling these governments that. Although this may seem so important to Westerners, this is the least of most Muslim country's issues. Some people may argue that freedom to dress is one step closer, but in order to solve a problem, you need to go to the root of the problem. I believe education could be an answer to suppressing this problem. It will not completely solve it, but I believe in most scenarios, if people are educated enough, they can make proper decisions. Whether they choose democracy, communism, or socialism, it's about what is best for their culture and community. Dressing like a Westerner simply isn't going to work in the predominately Muslim countries. "
worldnews,"Now, reports continue to come in that the BUK missile system, developed in the Soviet Union and clearly a Russian system today, reportedly shot down MH17. According to Wikipedia, typical BUK missiles seem to have engagement altitudes that range from at least 30 ft, up to, at most, 82,000 ft. Their horizontal engagement ranges are generally over 30 km. Therefore the capability of a such a missile to engage an airliner at 33,000 feet from a fair distance seems likely. Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buk_missile_system#Missiles"
worldnews,Not only would there be no warning but an intercepting missile is extremely hard to see since it would have an intersecting trajectory with the plane. The missile would be a static dot that would only look bigger as it got closer. At multiple times the speed of sound it would not be easy to notice even if someone was looking right at it unaware that it was targeting them. An experienced combat pilot has a hard time finding them even with a warning system. They just release countermeasures and start to yank and bank hoping to defeat the threat. Horrifying.

A quantitative blood test that has a reasonable degree of accuracy could be incredibly important in treating people who don't realise they're sick, who refuse to believe they're sick (""back in my day we just went and dug a hole and hardened up when we felt sad"" etc), or who don't want to seek medical help because they see it as overwhelming and pointless.

Are the current wages of our soldiers a burden, or is the crumbling bridge in need of repair a burden, or are the deferred wages of previous workers (also known as pensions)? The answer to that for many is primarily a function of their ideology, pensions are no different than other forms of wage spending, why are they crushing burdens and not the current wages of workers or the purchases of military technology?

And the claim that they are expensive is true in the sense that the total sum of money owed is large, but not in the context of the size of the overall economy or the context of total government spending."

todayilearned,"I was waiting to get arraigned for a misdemeanor assault back in Jan 2013. There were about 40 of us in a room and the judge was calling us up one by one to set our bond. I kid you not, everyone in there was there for possession of pot with the exception of maybe 6 of us (myself included) 


This made me angry for a couple reasons:
1. Why are we crowding our jails for fucking pot? It's really a huge waste of time!  About half of the kids in for pot were first timers. This seemed like a way to get them entered into the system so they can keep an eye on them. 

2. If none of these pot smokers were here, I would have been arraigned in a couple of hours, not all fucking day. They do not belong in the same room as thieves, rapists and guys doing real crimes. It just jams everything up. "
science,"No. Animal studies show how safe things are for those animals.  We assume that is applicable to human beings.  Sometimes that is true, sometimes that is not.  Scientists do not make the assumption that if something is safe for animals that means it is safe for humans.

You should do some research and see if animal studies are used to determine if things are safe for human use.  You will find that animal studies are used as an indicator before starting studies on humans.  

I can only assume that you are making personal attacks because you know your position is indefensible and you are hoping to distract from that.  "

Like I stated earlier, the only obligation signatories have to Ukraine if the agreement is breached or Ukraine is threatened is:

A) Meet with other signatory nations

B) If Ukraine is nuked, a meeting of the UN Security council

Yes, the treaty says signatories have to respect Ukraine's sovereignty, BUT, the treaty gives zero obligation for anyone to do anything except the above. They don't even have to speak out against Russia, since they aren't obligated to.

You can't say we're better unless the other group is extinct - which is ~99%(?) of all living organisms last I read. But if it is alive it is no more successful as a species when compared to humans.

My point is that meat isn't the problem, it's economies and governments, which tend to get in the way of people, though oddly enough they have the nasty habit of helping people a lot too. You want everyone to eat? Make it a human right, force every government to feed its people, and if they don't, make them. Killing cows and bankrupting ranchers isn't going to solve word hunger any time soon. Getting the abundance of food we have to the people will, the question is how do you do that?"

iama,"My overly hostile response was in the wrong, and im sorry for that.

But i feel that my overall point stands, however. 

In this scenario, a kid accidentally fired a gun he stole from a house where the weapon wasn't secured. Speaking literally, if in a environment of gun ban or high gun control, this scenario wouldn't have happened. There would have been no gun to steal, or even if it was there, it would be secured. 

In this scenario, due to the lax gun laws, Law Enforcement had no way to predict or prevent this crime. In fact, the only person who could have prevented this crime was the person with the gun - a 13 year old kid with no knowledge of gun safety."

Because pharmaceutical drugs are not a luxury item in most cases.

For most people, access to their medical treatments are an absolute necessity (and arguably a fundamental human right as well). I don't *need* an iPhone and I certainly don't have a right to an iPhone, but I *need* my blood pressure medication. You see?

Not to mention that if a patient comes in with cancer, their doctor, if he/she is worth their salt, is going to offer them the appropriate medicine for their condition. You don't need to advertise that sort of medication.

As others mentioned, there are only 2 countries in the world that allow prescription drugs to be advertised on free-to-air TV direct-to-consumer.

Because Westerners created the climate that allowed this problem to fester the way it did.  There would be no Islamic State in Syria and Iraq if the West hadn't spent a great deal of effort destabilizing Iraq by invading it, and destabilizing Syria by arming and training rebel factions.  Why do you expect the Arab League to fix a problem that was created by us?  Maybe the West should stop fucking toppling governments and funding revolutionaries if they don't want to deal with the fallout of doing that?

Greece is currently an economic shithole with half the country unemployed, my guess is that whatever party is in power is effectively using racial politics to blame all their problems on illegal immigrants (The top comment is condoning killing all illegal immigrants,  and take a look at OP's username).  When in fact it's more to do with the top E.U. nations like Germany oversupplying the smaller members like Greece with credit to increase their own personal exports, then refusing to bail them out when that system inevitably failed.  

Greece is going to be fucked up for quite a while, both economically and politically while it adjusts to austerity, and they only have themselves to blame for letting their country get to this point.  "
iama,"Good question and I confess not to be a hydrogen expert by any means.  The issue of power storage is a critical one for clean energy, for sure.  And in fact, we will definitely need to see some further development in this area in coming years if renewables are to continue to make major inroads. But it's important to keep things a bit in perspective: we don't anticipate clean energy accounting for the majority of the power generated in the world anytime soon.  There is a long, long way to go.  Hydrogen is one of a number of power storage options being explored but the more interesting one may actually end up being lithium-ion batteries (the kinds used in electric cars).  There is currently a bit of a glut in the manufacturing capacity of these kinds of batteries and this is helping to drop their price.  That will make electric vehicles more cost competitive -- but could also have good results for larger scale power storage on the grid."

Maybe you have your reasons, like wanting to go back there or being afraid of consequences, or simply not wanting to deal with a potential headache given by discussing North Korean politics. I completely understand if that's the case, but you shouldn't have made this AMA. 

You can't make an AMA about going to North Korea without being prepared to answer these questions. It's probably the sole reason many people will check it out to begin with.

todayilearned,"To clarify...my argument is an appeal to budget allocation and the rationale behind it. Basically, if a CEO decides to embed calibration throughout his entire workforce he is effectively deciding to recognize outstanding performance for only 7-10% of his working population based on a distribution curve. It begs the question...why spend so much money recruiting and developing top notch candidates when you've already predetermined that 90% of them will NOT be outstanding performers? The process alone will have a negative impact on employee engagement as well as retention? The argument itself creates enough debate for most budget holders to reconsider.

As for it's effectiveness toward executives, it should be noted that executives are typically provided bonuses based exclusively on financial targets and NOT performance ratings. The ratings are instead used to support talent management and succession planning (who moves up...who stays where they are and who goes)."

There's a big difference. We have evidence that AIs can potentially exist. We have no evidence for a god. Gods were not invented to be benign, they were invented to explain why bad things happen.

Any AI that humans invent will, by its nature of being developed by humans, think like a human does. They'll have roughly similar values to us by virtue of the way in which they think being shaped by the way in which we think.

Incidentally, there are two main 'schools' of philosophy; one of which emphasizing the linguistics and language of discourse; the other based around formal logics and clearly-defined statements. I happen to fit more closely into the analytical category, but to exclude the other people who call themselves 'philosophers' would be something of a true scotsman fallacy. But to be sure, it is not uncommon for works from the continental school of philosophy to be seen as artistic or poetic in nature - rather than ""philosophical"". This artistic side of philosophy is very real, but somewhat contentious within the ivory tower, and at least not representative of what ""most"" philosophers do, by the mainstream understanding"

There is no geological circulation and, unlike here in the West, China does not outsource its industry. This of course means that all the pollution produced by China happens within China in cities with populations several times those of the largest US cities. 

Most of the world's pollution actually comes from the United States where, in addition to having an extremely high per-capita ecological impact, most of its industries are outsourced to nations where pollution/labor laws are less strict.

We fish em :))
But, this is a review of multiple studies worldwide. But it's not so much as a billion every day. Last I read about worldwide (but that was data from some 20 years ago), the number was ~180billion/year worldwide. If we assume the rest of the world has increased meat production by the same as the US in that time, that number would today be ~300billion/year, which fits reasonably well with your a billion per day. 300 or 365... fairly close :)

But there are properly legal limits to liberal strategies. If a person *wants* to subjugate themselves to a limiting set of practices (e.g. by buying into traditional gender roles, or buying into a religion, or being a regular spectator of sport, etc) than that has to be their legal right, if we are describing a liberal society.

iama,"Yes you are correct on the signals - spot on. 
But I absolutely have to disagree with you on the evasive fearfulness you are saying is appropriate.
The fact of the matter is that an anxious/defensive dog will snap more than an ""aggressive/offensive"" dog.
What you're telling this person to do is to let the dog become anxious and avoid an infant - that's not positive and that's certainly a huge possibility for an increase in anxiety and then the possibly outlast from the dog if he/she feels threatened when cornered... 

@user - you need to create a positive relationship with the dog and the baby - make sure the dog does not see the infant as something to be feared of - because a fearful dog can and possibly will defend itself in whatever means it feels necessary. Even an inhibited bite will still cause some serious injury to someone of that age.

science,"I'm going to speculate that it has to do with clothes. I think men's clothing is more forgiving than clothes for women. If a guy gains 15 or 20 pounds, he's probably not going to look noticeably worse in his clothes. Women's clothing, on the other hand, is not so adaptable. If a woman gains 10 to 15 pounds, she goes up a size and has to buy new clothes, and the thinner she is initially the less weight she can gain before the clothes don't fit anymore. And the shorter she is, the more readily apparent is the weight gain. So a woman would start trying to lose weight before a guy might, because she's made aware of it sooner."

Now that you're doing TPB again, do you guys ever regret breaking character? I think I read an interview with JP once where he referenced Spinal Tap and enjoying staying in character etc.. Sorry for the long question.

It's a lot more complicated than just adding a checkbox.

Using and paying for Apps to use as your personal account was an odd choice. If you were expecting cutting edge features, that was probably not a great idea."

In the region in which I work, i.e., the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean (Near East), I think probably entanglement, materiality, actor network theory, creolization, hybridization, and network analysis are still the newest hot topics, though some have their roots earlier than ten years ago and in other fields. Most of the time these ideas begin in other disciplines and it takes a while for us to experiment and adopt them."

todayilearned,"I'm not a conservative, and I don't appreciate your conflating the pay gap myth, which is factually untrue, with climate change, which appears to be very true.

People with the same experience, the same responsibilities, doing the same work make the same income on average, regardless of gender.

You can claim there's a wage gap between the genders, but that's literally the same wage gap that exists between men who worked their whole lives and men who went traveling for a few years. In other words, it's not sexism, it's not discrimination, it's equality.

The real problem is your mindset where women are always victims. Women are people, and you should treat them like people. Stop trying to save them from imaginary evils; it's insulting and wrong."

It's the same issue with Wikipedia, where most studies report that Wikipedia's accuracy is as good or greater than other encyclopedias, yet a citation of Wikipedia might as well be saying a friend of a friend told you according to some people."

todayilearned,"The problem is that depression is not just low serotonin. Depression is a combination of thinking patterns, life views, thoughts, actions, experiences, etc that usually results in lower serotonin level (chemical imbalances) among other things. The solution is not to alter serotonin levels, but to actively change the way you think and live (therapy). And yes this is a lot more difficult.  To me SSRIs are kinda like continuing to pump air into a burst tire instead of trying to patch the hole. 

Although logic would suggest that more serotonin = more happiness, the opposite is often the case. I have a friend who described taking them a being in a zombie like state, and many people become suicidal while taking them. SSRIs have been proven to be as effective as placebos and imo should only be used as last resort."

In fact, most of the current gen retina displays aren't even made by Samsung, if any.

The truth is that if the majority of a population are made uncomfortable by something like this, and there is a somewhat acceptable reason they can pin it to (security issues), then that thing will very likely get banned. Now I'm not arguing for the morality of this, just the way that it works. I don't think goth dress makes enough people uncomfortable or provides a valid enough reason to be banned, same with Hasidic Jewish clothe. 

But socially the burqa is different as well, as it interrupts a lot of social norms essential to communication (body language, facial expressions) that those other forms of dress just don't. I think that's a bit part of it.

science,"it is not up to me to find sources for your claims.

the burden of proof is on the person making the claims.

[When debating any issue, there is an implicit burden of proof on the person asserting a claim. An argument from ignorance occurs when either a proposition is assumed to be true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is assumed to be false because it has not yet been proven true.[1][2] This has the effect of shifting the burden of proof to the person criticizing the assertion, but is not valid reasoning.[3]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophic_burden_of_proof)

worldnews,"My expectation of AI is very simply, to make use of all the information given to them.

Now, a human could read a book and may not store even 20% of the content of the book word-by-word. But a computer (or AI) may actually store 100% copy of the work, but still couldn't make their own opinions or make use of the information in a useful manner. You can store gigabytes of texts onto a HDD and the computer would simply be a dumb repository of information but not one to process those information.

Until we can give a book to an AI and tell them to give us the gist of it, then we have reached the first step of AI. Next would be for the book to form its own opinion, and changes its opinion as it learns more about the subject from other books. 

The 3rd and final form of AI would be when it could form its own ideas, based on the knowledge that it already has, thus rendering us all useless. It can surpass us in terms of generating original ideas, i.e thinking for itself and for us.  "
iama,"&gt; teaming up with people around our playing field?

Yes, absolutely. But not necessarily within your same genre/audience. Some of the best collaborations come when you work with someone that doesn't necessarily share the same audience/demographic as you. 

Don't be afraid to ask channels larger than you, just don't be offended if they say no, or ignore you. Generally though: if you approach someone with an interesting (and fleshed out) idea, without making them do too much work, many will be happy to help. Don't forget to pay it forward though... for every larger collaboration I did, I usually tried to feature a smaller channel too.

People always love talking about themselves, and reaching new audiences, however small: so to sweeten the deal, just let them be themselves, be creative, and you should have some success. It helps if you have any sort of relationship with the channel of course."

I only said that this event makes it much more likely for NATO to accept Ukraine's invitation to provide military assistance in suppressing *Ukrainian rebels*. 

*If* rebels shot down a plane full of European civilians it certainly gives NATO reason to assist Ukraine in suppressing the rebels. 

Of course this is just personal speculation. If I let my imagination run wild here's what I think would occur: Russia would be very outspoken against NATO involvement. They would most likely accelerate providing their own ""assistance"" in stabilizing Eastern Ukraine through annexation as in Crimea. I'm guessing Ukraine would wind up split with some Ukraine/NATO controlled regions and some Rebel/Russian controlled regions. NATO and Russian forces would avoid any direct/overt/prolonged engagements with each other and certainly no declared war. "

Private prisons allow for direct benefits to be accrued by the private individual from the government, thus creating a morally abhorrent monetary incentive for the individual to continue to support the war on drugs and even further the scope of it. These private prisons then, due to the direct relationship between money and political power in the US, utilize their monetary gains to further solidify their position and benefits through lobbying and super PACs. By removing private prisons you remove a large portion of the lobby in favor of harsher and more frequent drug sentencing.

In my view, that suggestion even belittles his piety in a way that says he wasn't all that pious at all, maybe even suggesting that he would consider his own taste in languages to be superior to the dictates of the Church. No one is saying he didn't have linguistic preferences, but I think it's safe to say those wouldn't have directed his understanding of doctrine."

For the most part a good subject knowledge helps with student enjoyment, and being able to go into the cases in detail (especially the more gruesome ones!).

I never studied Roman Law, but the English Legal System is heavily based on the Roman system (most legal systems have evolved heavily from Roman advocacy), and I had to learn a lot of latin phrases when I was studying my degree. I don't remember many of them now (ignorantia juris non excusat is always worth remembering though if you ever want to crack out a latin phrase to show off).

Studying law is really hard anywhere, but, as with a lot of difficult things, its very much worth it!"
worldnews,"&gt;I think Lenin, Engels, Grigory Zinoviev, Kamenev and Leon Trotsky, would have a fair idea of what Communism is. 

Public opinions of dead gurus. Only relevant for people who trust in authority over everything else, even their own sanity. All these men are long dead, their personal goals and their false promises with them. But quite a few zombies still follow their yellowed, faded orders to the letter as if they were still alive. And they are damn proud to do so. Would be funny if it weren't so sad.

Yes yes, the similarity with every other salvation cult out there is pure coincidence. The communists are the extra special snowflakes. Just like all the others too."

1. What are your thoughts on playing at big festivals like EDC? I was hoping for you to show up on the lineup for Vegas this year, but was disappointed to see that you weren't there!

2. What was your inspiration for the song Vanilla? It's probably one of my favorite songs from you.

I also just want to tell you that you're really fucking awesome. I've been following you since about 2012, and you definitely have been one of my favorite producers throughout these years. I love how in touch you are with your fans, and love your views on the scene. You're definitely one of the people at the top of my must see list, and I'm hoping to finally see you for the first time the next time you come out to SF!"
iama,"Motivation is a hard thing to explain succinctly.

I guess at the core, the undergraduate classes I was teaching is all stuff that's in text books and available online, so I didn't feel like I was providing any secret information that would be unavilable.

I'm talking about iimmigrants who will not make excuses about oppression and racism, who will just get out there and succeed.  

Honestly, if you're against having at least a small influx of these type of immigrants (small enough that they assimilate) I think that would very much qualify as racist. [Indians, and to a lesser extent, other Asians fit this bill in the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income).

The ban on gay scouts has been lifted, but the ban on gay scout leaders and adult volunteers hasn't. Pretty sure I technically shouldn't be able to be a camp counselor; however, my bosses and coworkers are pretty relaxed/liberal.

I've also heard from other counselors (but not confirmed) that Western Los Angeles County Council (which my camp falls under) has a more relaxed policy than the national organisation does.

Our rock climbing programme utilises an artificial wall (on a trailer hitch) as well as a natural rock within our camp. Occasionally we'll take the kids out of camp to climb elsewhere if they can handle it."
science,"Many people will not even know they have EBV. (I never had mono, and so didn't know for sure until I joined Alan's group, whereupon I joined the ranks of lab donors giving blood for EBV research.)

If you catch the virus later in life (say young adulthood) then you may (though not always) get mono. Many doctors will diagnose mono on the basis of symptoms without a blood test (since in many cases it clears up by itself) so sometimes people think they've had EBV-associated mono, but its actually been caused by another agent. The blood test also has false positive and negative rates. The person then gets EBV-mono and think they've had it multiple times (which doesn't happen).

If you buy product A, all the pollution due to the manufacturing of that good is on your head. The fact that it happened elsewhere from the place you live is irrelevant. Unless you only buy goods produced in countries with heavy regulations (and thus willing to pay much more for those goods), you're just as much part of the problem. 

the fact that you're paying the chinese to shoulder the majority of the impact of the pollution caused by the manufacture of the goods you use magically absolves you of responsibility? Thats how your mind works? Seriously? "
science,"This is pretty true - look at any serious fitness-related realm, such as /r/fitness or /r/loseit, and you will find plenty of advocates for taking care of your diet first and foremost to lose weight - even though many of those people buff up and build muscle too. Some common phrases are ""weight loss is 80% diet, 20% fitness"" and ""you can't outrun a bad diet"" and ""abs are built in the gym, but revealed in the kitchen.""

It takes more effort/time to burn off half a pizza in the gym than it does to just eat a healthier lower-calorie meal instead. People don't gain large amounts of weight for not exercising, they gain large amounts of weight because they eat more calories than they need."
science,"Define rare?

You have doctors that order EBV tests, the IgG scale is 0.9 to 23.0, and you have people come back with 294 and 312 on multiple tests, and then they say, ""oh, that's not EBV, that's a lab error/cross reaction (with a mythical antigen)"".  They run the test again, same thing.

Then they ignore it.  So then it's not documented.  So then it's rare.

But...is it really?  

Look at the people in this thread quoting places like this, places that don't take you seriously if you are in the margins, or if things don't like up exactly like they expect them to...

It is still a pursuit of power -- which I've readily acknowledged could be used for good.  I doubt those that isolate themselves from others are as likely to be seeking power over others as those that engage with others and make a show of it. IF -- big if -- there exists an all mighty all knowing god, then, yes, we agree that free will is an illusion.  Even in the absence of a controlling power, there exists forces beyond our control,  so, while to an extent we can certainly control our actions, the idea that any of us can actually wholly control our lives or even our own thoughts is also an illusion."

Getting COPD without smoking is related to the quality of the air people breath. Pollution in many cases (live next to a coal burning plant? etc..)

 Very much attributed to cooking with oils with underventilation. -Steam Aerosolizing of oils + breathing fumes (for many many years) -&gt; COPD.      
 Obviously, women in third world countries, where open flame cooking is still common are at the highest risk.  Don't forget coal fired heating and cooking will pollute the air too..  Imagina a whole town using coal to heat? Just like living next to a coal burning power plant. "

On top of that non state actors who would want to sabotage Sony probably knew that they could use ""The Interview"" as an excuse to throw off the authorities, who is to say this was not an inside job or the work of cyber criminals who have no connection to North Korea? I think more evidence needs to be made public before any accusations are made. "

This reminds me of something that happened while my friend was in the ER.

We were looking for a plug to charge a phone, and my friend noted that all the plugs had the ground on top instead of on bottom.  We wondered why and he remarked that it was probably just the way the contractor did it.  I responded that there was no way this wasn't something that the hospital had a clear cut policy on; they have policies on damn near everything and loads of documents to back it up.  We looked it up, and it turns out I was right.  Plugs in hospitals have the ground on top to prevent a dangerous short should anything manage to drape over a plug that is only partially inserted.

iama,"Hi Barbara!  I had an opportunity today to use my favorite ""at work"" joke.  Whenever something breaks or someone leaves for a better paying job (like today), I say ""well, you know, we're a very poor multi billion dollar corporation...""

The CEO gets paid tens of millions, but can't afford to shell out a few extra thousand to keep a good person around.  Nothing is done, though, because the former is a ""job creator"" and is practically worshiped in today's society.  The latter - a guy who does a good job?  Not so much.

So I guess my question is, what can we do to make the ""job performer"" an object of worship once again?  We've devalued labor (literally and metaphorically) and exalted ""small business"" to the point where if all you have is a job, you're a chump.  If you're an ""entrepreneur"" you have more value to society.

Can we change that?

science,"We can test for antibodies to the virus, which will show if you’ve been infected or not. We can also detect the virus itself in blood and also in the saliva (which is how the virus transmits from person to person).

 For most people, however, it’s not going to matter if you are EBV pos or neg – except if you’ve got the virus then its unlikely that you could be reinfected. 

We study the virus by taking samples from people in our department (the people we work with are very helpful and donate blood samples all the time) as well as medical school students. So we know who is EBV negative and who is EBV positive (and sometimes find people becoming infected – usually coincident with a new boyfriend/girlfriend!). In fact, it was the observation in 1967 that a technician suddenly had high levels of EBV antibodies immediately after having mono that linked EBV to the illness.

I don't know if the memorandum had anything in it against the change of borders by peaceful legal and democratic means.

iama,"Thinking sex is gross when your eight is normal for children, but if this is still your main reason for being asexual as an adult I find it to be quite immature. As an AMA I was hoping for more specific answers to be able to understand the why's ad how's of being asexual but just claiming it's ""yuk"" is a pretty childish excuse. 

The same goes for alcohol. Kids mostly will choose what they like by the way food looks or smells before even knowing what it tastes like, and just because something smells a certain way doesn't mean it tastes the same.

Most Muslim women come in contact with this debate at some point in their lives and most of them choose to continue wearing it either as a point of modesty or of pride. 55% of the people who took this survey were, in fact, women, and note that this survey states *prefer*, not what is allowed."

Get with the times... I'm not going to sit glued to my TV on Saturday night like I might have used to.

Edit: To circumvent all the ""Hey, SNL posts stuff online!"" comments: Yes, I know that.  I get it.  The point is that they still massively flag SNL videos uploaded by other parties and completely control what's allowed to be shared.  While they upload ""a lot"", it's far from comprehensive.  If you're trying to find a lot of content from the early 90's, for example, you're SOL.

2. Once we were past closing time my buddy teamed up with some waiters working in a club and we went to this pub operated by an older fellow that behind closed doors went on for an all-nighter. Once we got in (it wasn't easy) and seeing that it was packed, I understood that this bar is a well-known secret of people working in bars and clubs who want to keep partying after work. It went on until the morning. Is this place an unique thing or there are many places like that? It basically made my day :)"

science,"I think it depends on the origin of your depression.  If it's because you're treating your body badly, that can be changed.  If it's because you're in a rut due to life dealing you some tough cards, that can be worked through.  If it's because there's something different about your brain and it naturally doesn't produce the right chemicals known to be optimal to mental well-being, that can be treated.

However, IMO, the hardest type of depression to deal with is the existential type.  When you see life as painful and pointless, it's a lot harder to radically alter your perceptual framework than it is to hit the gym, get some talk therapy, take an SSRI, or whatever.  "
worldnews,"I didn't intend to debate any of that. I just meant to emphasize that you need a lot more than the fact that she was briefed on it and then did nothing about it to say she ""signed off"" on it. She may well have been glad the program was in place, she may well be ""rotten to the core"" or whatever else you want to say, but to say she signed off on it, you need to show explicitly that she had the opportunity to prevent it, or at least vote against it in some meaningful way. Being briefed and saying to the media ""we have to do something the we have not wanted to do"" does not meet that requirement. It may not be a stretch to say she agreed the program was justified -- a lot of people in this country apparently do, so it's at least reasonably likely that she might as well -- but to say she signed off on it requires more than that."
worldnews,"So say they get pulled over on the highway and the two officers are men. You are telling me it's a slight inconvenience for them to call on the radio for a female officer to come over. 10-15 min pass by if they are lucky and then the two male officers have to leave or be out of viewing distance so that only the female officer sees her face.

This is all before they can do anything.

That is not a small inconvenience, it's a waste of tax payer money and a huge security concern. 

If someone has committed a civil infraction or committed a crime the police need to be able to identify the person right away. A license is useless if they can't see the person's face.

Also, it complicates security a lot as you have people who won't show their face unless it's a woman. This practice also has a history of being used to sneak in suicide bombers closer to their targets. Only an extreme minority do this of course but we need to be able to guard against it.

worldnews,"The material is not irrelevant, It demonstrates that atrocities in the name of religion in the modern age are not restricted to Islam.  Violent and oppressive tendencies result from poverty, a lack of an education, and untreated mental health issues.  Not the specific tenants of any Religion.  They are all so open-ended that any of them can be used as a tool for violence and oppressive tendencies.  Islam is easily interchangeable with Christianity and just about any other ideology.

science,"They take a blood and/or tissue sample from both of these kids. The cells in the sample are then subjected to a virus. Normal cells from another person are mixed with the same virus, this is the positive control, for comparison.. All the cells are then broken open (lysed) and the soup of cell guts (lysate) are screened for RNA or DNA from the virus (qt-PCR).  If the virus made it into the cell and replicated there will be viral RNA or DNA in the cell soup. They then compare how much viral DNA/RNA came from the cells from the kids and compare it to the amount that came from normal cells (the control). [The results look like this for the HIV screen](http://i.imgur.com/qAryBMd.jpg). The grey bar is the positive control, the red is kid 1 and yellow kid 2. In this case this data shows a lot less HIV DNA was present in the kids'  cells, it is reasonable to infer from this data that less HIV was able to enter the cells from the kids and replicate."
science,"Compounding with the issues you've raised here is the fact that it is still difficult to manufacture exacting miRNA look a likes.

When you compound this with the  promiscuous nature of the miRNA, it becomes very hard to target specifically. Especially with the many families of miRNA separated by single base pair mismatches. "
science,"As stated this is possible and happens in nature all the time. For instance certain 'pathogens' have lost genes that would otherwise allow them to replicate outside of their host. As someone else alluded, the loss would happen quicker if there is an energy cost to keeping the gene: one can imagine the more efficient evolved organisms (that is without the gene) would out compete the resistant organisms. Loss of resistance would be quicker in plasmid driven resistance as opposed to genes on the chromosome. 
Without an energy cost the loss of the gene would certainly take longer. I guess its possible to see if a cost could be created in some manner. It's always about energy

Whatever he grew up in Boston, Oklahoma or Africa he would score about the same, unless he living in one of those areas caused him to suffer a traumatic brain injury. Whatever he stays his entire life in the african village is rather irrelevant to how intelligent he is. 

In fact, studies with identical twins growing up apart of each found that they still had closely matching IQ. Environment is much less important than genes when it comes to intelligence. "

The entire idea of victimhood can occasionally be a gray area (I know this is an unpopular opinion to hold in the states).

It all depends on company culture and how senior leadership views HR - is it tactical or strategic?

I have two suggestions.  Play EA Sports FIFA game and learn the different feels of each team -- how the players play, how the formations feel.  It can truly help you understand the team's personality from within.

2. Choose Everton.  They are like the US.  A team whose collective effort trumps the individuals on paper.  Roberto Martinez who I have loved spending time with here in Brazil is a magical optimist like Jurgen.  Tim Howard is our goalkeeper/hero.  And we have a long line of Americans who have triumphed including McBride, Landon, and Joe Max Moore who the fans lovingly named Joe Max Less.

Two, I should probably read all the way through the study, but we would have to observe older and deceased athletes to accrue mortality statistics. This represents a very different lifestyle compared to athletes today. I mean, athletes playing in the 1960's would have lived dramatically different lives.

So, would the conclusions infer lifestyle adjustments or genetic advantage?"

The only way I've come up with to avoid this is to create some universe for them to live in where they know nothing about us, but where we can still use them for our own needs. At the very least the total suffering should be around the same since their suffering is balanced by alleviating our own. I hope there's a better way though."

Releasing the type of NODs used, the amount of ammunition carried, and some of the other details of what they carried directly endangers the ability of those after him. Talking about how they flew in and assaulted that compound? They probably can't use those tactics again now.

NDAs in this case exist to protect Americas ability to field the best killers, and prevent the enemy from gaining information to kill our killers. "

I wanted to join to serve my country, to gain the experience, and to follow in my dad's footsteps. My most memorable moment was seeing the look on my parents' face when I graduated from basic training. Also, when I was in Afghanistan, we had Afghanistan civilians working on the FOB. I was walking back from showering, I had my PTs and shower shoes (flip flops) on. One of the Afghanistan guys saw that my toes were painted and thought that was the coolest thing. The next day, he told me that he had told his sister and she got excited because she wanted hers done someday.

The islamist militias were the only groups fighting for the country as a whole and have served very loyally to the new Libyan government.  However, the Libyan government failed to start integrating militias into an official military (that takes money) and command hierarchy problems (or just a lack of such) resulted in a breakdown of order within the ranks.  

This and many other factors have bled the country of the militias that it depended on for order and unity and left a very weak government with no way to resist or reconcile the many heavily armed tribes.

I get that as a user we want what we're used to. My point was just that maybe there's a better way to do it. Adding a feature can sometimes be clutter so it's best to add it when it's the best known solution to a use case rather than to just add it because that's how it was done in the past. Putting it under an extra menu button often allows legacy support while encouraging the user to transition to the new solution.

For searching your email it sounds like you're getting tons of unwanted results and your work around is to delete emails predicting that you'll probably never want to search for them. I solve this by refining my search rather than deleting emails I can never undelete. However, I'm curious as to what other users encounter that the same solution doesn't solve it for them."

science,"&gt; Does it check for fabricated data specifically? How can it? 

Because you check the methodology as well. If the study featured a sample size that was more than adequate to give clear results, and the conclusion matches the results, then you can be sure the results are accurate. If you use a tiny sample size, it will be obvious that the data is insufficient. That is why the Seralini study was thrown out: his sample size was tiny and the rats he used in his two year study are extremely prone to tumours at two years old. It was clear the the study was purposely manipulated to give a predetermined result, and was therefore trashed.

If there is no clear evidence that the sample was inherently flawed, then the sponsor of the study is utterly irrelevant because the results would have occured regardless of who provided the funds."

However the guy who invested in corn can just turn it into high fructose corn syrup and sell it for profit. Or ethanol if gasoline prices are too high.

Anyway, point is, when the drug is illegal, drug dealers do not care how old you are, so long as you pay them. Legal, licensed institutions do care about your age, for fear of losing their license to sell, produce, etc. the drug. Legalization seriously restricts the access to the drug by teenagers."

Yet at the same time we see doctors and nurses who are wearing PPE become infected.  We see this spreading exponentially.   And now we have our first case here in the US.  Why do they downplay the risks of Ebola?  The science I read contradicts what most Virologists and Doctors say about EBola when they are on TV.  For example I read that it survives 4 hours on surfaces even when exposed to light,   even longer in humid environments,  and indefinatly if frozen.  It can be passed in semen for 8 weeks after people are leaving Ebola Treatment Centers as well which no one talks about.

I think the greater ecological worry is about crops that allow for the wholesale use of proprietary herbicides (RoundUp most famously). It is true that RoundUp does not persist for terribly long in the environment, to the best of anyone's knowlege, and is in many ways safer than herbicides that are better able at 'targeting' weeds - however, the 'RoundUp Ready' technology is a bit of a sneaky way to make money on both the crop as well as the chemical that has to go with it, and in many ways it does encourage a very liberal use of chemicals that would otherwise be used in greater moderation.

&gt; mirror our justice system on that of an oppressive regime

I would hope that most people would get that all I was implying that American courts should follow the Chinese example of actually punishing exceedingly rich individuals the same as anyone else, and not assume that I am specifically advocating capital punishment.  But that ignores the fact that your average redditor will jump to conclusions if they can get their righteous fury on as soon as they even suspect they smell blood in the water.  My bad for forgetting that people like you are looking for an excuse to look down on someone else."
iama,"It would appear so, the joys of working in Canada and the amount of red tape.  I'm looking at getting into this, but the paperwork and headaches are discouraging to say the least.  I don't see a problem for people living rurally but I understand it in the city.  Its annoying as hell when the government doesn't make distinctions between rural Canada and cities, this is what people actually read and see on drones:

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/drone-seen-flying-in-path-of-landing-planes-at-vancouver-airport-1.2693601

Clearly flying a drone over crops there's zero chance of hurting someone, and if it does crash the only loss is a couple corn plants."
science,"Thank you for being so honest. I hope you don't blame yourself for what happened. (Actually I'm pretty sure you don't... or am I wrong?) It sounds like you did what you could to try and let people know you were concerned about her.

I believe, 100%, in this study and what you're saying, by the way. I'd never underestimate a psychopath, having lived with one for eight years. He was, and is, the man who most people adore. He knows how to work them. And I know that he hates me--because I left him and that's impermissible because it wasn't his decision--but he still acts smooth and perfect to my face to this day, six years later. Meanwhile he will lie and cheat and steal, against me, against everyone. I can't say that I admire it because that's the wrong word, but it astounds and impresses me, the games he can run with people."
worldnews,"This is really fascinating. My mother is very big on traditional Chinese medicine (she grew up and lived in Shandong, China until she was in her late 20s) and every time I had a cold or flu she would insist I drink honeysuckle tea. 

I always blew her off because I'm a western-trained scientist but looks like I may owe my mother an apology. While it's certainly no indication that ingesting honeysuckle might actually grant the benefits of MIR2911 (in the same way that you can ingest scorpion poison but it entering your bloodstream is another issue), but I was certainly wrong when I said it was all hogwash."
todayilearned,"There is no comparison in your response.

You create your review, therefore you do what you want with it, the developer has no ownership of it. 

If they want to release a demo or make the game free that should be up to them. No matter what good you think it does for them it's still not up to you to decide if you should be able to grab the game and play it before you buy it. Because it's not your decision to make, when you move forward with downloading it anyways then that's stealing. Your decision is more like ""since you won't let me play this before I buy it then I'm not going to buy it"".

Like I said, I understand the appeal of downloading all of this shit for free, but I don't understand the attitude that it is somehow above essentially shoplifting.  "
science,"So you don't let others affect you. That's a valuable and powerful trait. You should look into being a research subject. There has been several studies on mirror neurons, perhaps you are missing them. Another point I want to bring up is the difference between sympathy and empathy. Sympathy is attempting to feel for the other person out of kindness and respect even if you don't know how they feel. Empathy is feeling what someone else is experiencing through your own personal experience. Have you never cried watching a movie? "

I do not have enough background to judge the research properly, and I don't want to be one of those people discrediting research simply because of the source. But she was a project leader for Monsanto, there is potential for bias here and that makes me hold my judgement until I can get more information from fellow Redditors. It is just hard to keep yourself unbiased when your research is showing whether or not you may have put the health of millions at risk. 

Edit: I did not like the wording I used. I find this shows I am aware of possible confirmation bias on my own end.

todayilearned,"&gt;Eugenics was the racist pseudoscience determined to wipe away all human beings deemed ""unfit,"" preserving only those who conformed to a Nordic stereotype.

That's not even close to an accurate definition. This writer is trying to conflate all eugenics with racism and fascism, but it happens not to be true. Most eugenics students studied, believed, and practiced very innocuous things, even by modern standards. But when you try to conflate the study of genetics and breeding for the purposes of improving the human experience with Adolph Hitler and the holocaust, you end up with idiots who think Planned Parenthood are Nazis, or who think Francis Collins is mapping the human genome in order that we all become genetic experiments in a fascist state of scientific racism."
iama,"I see a lot of hope for the breed, stemming from good breeders.  I know of a lot who are working on fixing said hip problems.  Most I know go through the OFFA to test the hips and elbows before breeding.  There are things being done, but not as efficiently as should be done.  If it were me, I would require the hips to be tested for displasia or any issues with the joints before showing/breeding.  I would never allow a dog with poor hips to enter the ring.

If I were to switch breeds, I would love to work with golden retrievers.  They are a lovely breed, and excellent in terms of obedience and therapy work which I've always loved.  They're also a relatively healthy breed, like the Belgians.  I have seen many of each in the ring, by the way, and Malinois are a great breed!

I love German lines.  They tend to be better working dogs in general, in my opinion, and I love the coats.  "
iama,I use Google Apps for my personal/primary and I have always been VERY frustrated with Google for not releasing all the features that regular @gmail.com users have. One of the biggest ones (besides Inbox) is Google Now. I refuse to buy anymore Android products such as the Moto 360 that I want so bad only because Google Now is the main feature and all I get is bloody traffic updates and weather. That's it! Why is it so hard to release package tracking and all the other awesome features regular users have?!
askreddit,"My downstairs neighbors last year would throw ragers on Thursday nights- this was despite me letting them know that I worked at 5:45am on Fridays, despite my roommates letting them know that they had class or worked at 8am, and despite one of my roommates letting them know that she was in OChem and wanted a quiet apartment to study in at night.  ""We have the right to be loud when we want to"". 

But if we were at all audible to them on Saturday night?  Even if it was just 4 or 5 people over for drinks and a little music playing?  They'd go to the breaker box and shut off our electricity.  They never told us why they didn't like us being ""loud"" on Saturdays, just that they ""deserved respect"".  We tried shutting off their electric once and they tattled to the landlord.

Fuck college."
iama,"I get what you're saying, but *most* corporations are really well run. Many businesses of all sizes from independent bakeries and hair salons to large multi-nationals are incorporated as ""corporations"". In my estimation and experience, the VAST majority of them only survive if they have good employee culture.

It's only the large mono/oligopolies that can survive with rotten culture in areas of limited competition, either due to natural monopolies (rare) or government-ensured ones (usually the case).

If you're ever curious, look at the lobbying and revolving door record of any ""corporation"" you really dislike."

science,"I'm not against it. Manufacturing is not coming back to the USA. Period. Sure a company may come back or insource something that used to be outsourced. But it's not coming back in masses. It's a big reason why unions have had plummiting numbers, influence and pro union legislation. 

All of that is positive. We are a service economy now. Done right this could mean a higher median income for many workers.

However, whatever you need, whatever you want, as a person or business, you could find it made in the USA. Need shoes? Buy new balance. Want an American car? A lot of Mercedes are made here. I live down the street from the plant that makes every C series car sold across the planet. 

You can find anything you need that has no China influence. You have to look and you have to be willing to pay for it. "
science,"Edits: all feedback is welcome for this, add a relevant link and I'll update it on this post. It's midnight my time, it's a controversial subject, and I'd like for this to be a civil discourse. 

[This Article Addresses some of the issues](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/organic-farming-yields-and-feeding-the-world-under-climate-change/)

The key point is that organic farming methods provide 25% less yield (in cereal crops) than non-organic farming methods. 

World population right now is projected to be 9 billion people by 2030 

[And here's a nice graphic depicting world food surpluses and defecits](http://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2012/05/food)

The biggest importers of food are in the Middle East and Africa, which also have the highest birthrates. 

Organic methods alone cannot meet the expected food demand in this time period. "
science,"Hi! So glad you're already excited about teaching the next generation of scientists. I think it really depends on the age you are considering. Deep time I think is an especially difficult to comprehend at any age! And in order to get across the idea of changed in populations overtime, rather than individuals, you need to address tricky concepts such as sex and death. But just because they're difficult they shouldn't be ignored! If you're thinking of teaching the little ones, my first book ""Little Changes"" tried to address some of these topics, again using a poetic bedtime story format like Great Adaptations (you can read it for free at www.rinkidinks.co.uk). There are some teaching resources on the website too."

worldnews,"The Ukrainian government hasn't exactly shown a lot of love for the East and South even before all this happened. Overturning the Russian Trade agreement and taking the EU trade agreement was a pretty big middle finger to the East and South, who would have benefitted more from the Russian trade agreement then the EU one. It sets a centralist policy. I can understand why some of them might actually think Russia is better for them. 

Realistically, to them an authoritarian Russia isn't really much difference.  Most of them will just fit right in, so it's not like they're worried about losing rights or anything."
worldnews,"I'm impressed that you created a new account just to troll me. I'm also guessing you're going after me by trying to attack a seemingly innocuous comment, rather than the one that really set you off, probably having to do with me calling out racists.

I hope that one day you find peace and don't have to resort to turning that self-hatred outward, under a guise of anonymity, like a self-loathing coward. That sort of behavior will only reinforce your internalized hatred."
todayilearned,"I have to agree. The way he delivers that last monologue about the dream he has with the old man on the horse just passing him by, it really blew me away. 

He just seemed so defeated, exhausted, and utterly confused about this huge war he'd gotten sucked into over the money. He was the only truly good character, as everyone else made questionable decisions as to what to do with the money, while he only seeks to stop the madness before too much damage is done.

But of course, he's too late; he has a bad day at work. People died. Oh well. Let's just try to go back to normal life tomorrow and go ride horses with the wife. 

It really portrays the toll a job like that can take on someone's psyche as people prove time and time again that they will resort to unbelievable acts of evil all for the sake of greed/pride/power.

todayilearned,"Well the shelf life of those chemicals is measured in weeks, which is why we were concerned about when Syria was mixing the chemicals cause it meant they had to be used within like 20 days. So the agents are definatly inert. As for the chemical byproducts of what's left, it's a lot of chemical in a whole lot more ocean. I don't like the dumping of chemical in the ocean, but at the same time I'm not too worried about it. What I am worried about is the fact that they don't know where they dumped it,"

The link between vaccines/mercury and autism has been destroyed time and time again, but some people still seem to hold on to that as a cause -- I'm not convinced of a link, whatsoever. I have found myself to show a lot of the same traits, though never professionally diagnosed. Other parents of autistic children at my son's school seem to show similar behaviors as well. Are we any closer to finding the root cause of autism and other forms of spectrum disorders, and is there any kind of confirmed genetic links from the parents? "
worldnews,"Glad to see Australia also taking swift action. I wonder what the UNSC meeting tomorrow is going to say. *Technically* the Russians have a veto there, but nobody is going to take anything they say in there seriously, methinks. Can the general UN assembly override a security council veto? We could really use a significant blue-helmet force in that area. Would help with the investigation as well.

It seems so absurd that Russia is still trying to bullshit its way out of this. Previously, they might have only done it to benefit the interior, the voters of Russia. But now, it's not Russia's elections that hang in the scale, it's their last crumbs of credibility and standing internationally. And no RT or Itar-Tass is going to help with that."
science,"Hi Dr. Shepherd,

Thank you so much for doing this series! My question is about the biological causes of schizophrenia. I'm currently in a schizophrenia seminar at my university and it seems like there are so many correlations between genetic and environmental factors and the onset of schizophrenia.

Either way, your post is wrong. At 5'9 and 175lb I was ""overweight"" according to BMI.  And that's bullshit. BMI is only a general marker, and mostly for those who do not exercise. For those who do exercise, BMI doesn't mean a damn thing.  So, am I overweight? Yes...but that's ONLY taking weight into consideration. But if you were to see the physical differences between someone my height and weight but with substantially more bodyfat, you would see the difference.  Not to mention if you were to put that same person against me in doing physical activities. 

The reason I know this is because I used to be fat. I know the difference between what I looked like at 190lbs when I was fat vs 190 right now when I lift and count calories daily."

As a minimum wage employee, you are hired to push buttons. And even if you do actually give a shit about the company, the company still won't give a shit about you.

iama,"$0.70 cent tax for toasting? I guess it depends on how much your local area's tax is and  the price of your sandwich. I used to work at a Subway in California and the tax is not there because Subway wants it to be. The tax is there because the State of California decided that hot foods should be taxed. Sandwiches that are already hot (chicken, meatball, steak, pastrami, bacon) are already charged tax regardless if you get it toasted or not. Toasting these sandwiches does not make the sandwich cost more.

It's really stupid IMO. What sucks more is that if you decide to get a meal (chips and drink), they'll add on tax for the bag of chips if your sandwich was hot. They also charge tax on your entire order (regardless of if you sandwich was hot or not) if you tell them that you plan on eating inside the restaurant."

All of these are signs of some form of hypogonadism. Kallmans' specifically includes a greatly reduced or nonexistent sense of smell-if this is present, there's a reasonable likelihood he has it.

I went straight from feeling sorry for the guy to horse laughing in that one that scene.

Before you made that edit I was about to praise your great response. I say that because you're right... I don't know Ulrich's stance now.

Your second paragraph is really what I don't understand about the military culture.

Yeah. I wish I would have known more about the oil &amp; gas industry when I was younger. I'm glad to be a part of it now, but if I had known how much money was involved in the field, I would have just tried to start some service company or get involved somehow.

Take it back to the insane gameplay (as much as I liked EA's skate series, don't go with the realistic physics, please), take it back to the traditional ""Zero-to-Hero"" story and crank it to 11 (as always) and feature a list of both old and new Skaters and maps from previous games and not only have you got yourself a hit, but a game that may encourage a whole new generation to pick up skateboarding, just like THPS2 did.

Of course not. My only point was that it happens in the U.S. too, whereas a lot of commentors were making it sound like it doesn't. And to boot, no one has provided us with evidence to compare how often it happens in the Middle East vs. the U.S.  Everyone is just making assumptions based off anecdotal evidence in news stories.  Regardless, anyone who wants to claim they really care about women's rights needs to be working to stop this kind of abuse in the U.S. as well, not just arguing about why Americans are superior to Middle Easterners."

For this particular challenge, there is, sure. It shouldn't even be that hard. You could build a hacky web-based solution:

1)   When I post a comment about your work, the comment is submitted to both your server, and mine, and a trusted third-party server.

2)   My server, and the trusted third-party server, occasionally query your page to ensure my comment is still there

Obviously there are tensions between the two countries, and it affects the media as well, but I guess the accuracy of it really depends on what news agency you are asking about... The things being said on MSNBC is very different from what is said on Fox News. But overall, it is not so accurate. As I have already mentioned a few times in this thread, Iranians love foreigners and specially Americans. Most of the people think of Iran as a destroyed desert with people in it, but I must say that Tehran is one of the most beautiful and modern capitals in the world. So, I think you should see, before you can judge. "
iama,"What changes are you most anxious/excited to implement within the next year? Have you met any kind of community resistance coming into this kind of position as a layperson?

I graduated in 2012 and it was hard to watch MU go through such a bleak patch immediately after I left, especially from a distance. All that negativity, uncertainty and administrative turnover made me (and I imagine many others) feel so disconnected. 

You've reignited that connection. I'm even slightly envious of students on campus who are gaining the opportunity to work with such a transparent, approachable president. Since you've taken the reigns, I've heard nothing but positive, excited remarks about the state of the university and how bright the future is looking. Go Marquette!"

I suppose it does have its downsides, it's rather cheaply made (as you might expect), the manual ~~was~~ is in Korean and it's very barebones, but for the price and overall quality it'd be stupid to complain."

Whoever is bullying you is an insecure idiot and they're probably getting bullied by someone you don't know about. Just keep your chin up. Hang out with anyone who treats you like a human being, whether it's your family or friends online. "

Similar values are found in France and the United States.

I'm presuming you are Muslim but not Turkish, I honestly can't imagine you are Turkish if you don't realise how important secularism and keeping religion out of the state and public life is there, it would have been drummed into you in primary school.

&gt; Speed work defined
&gt;
&gt; For now, let’s define speed work as anything under a 7 RPE. If you complete a set and you could have done 5 or more reps, it counts as speed work. If you’re doing doubles or triples with less than 75%, it probably counts. If you’re doing singles with less than 85%, it probably counts. If this is just a warm-up to your heavier work, then it probably doesn’t count as speed work.

And [this response from Bret Contreras](http://bretcontreras.com/dynamic-effort-training-bs-or-legit/) says:

&gt; speed work (aka dynamic effort work, which involves performing lighter loads – usually between 50-60% of 1RM – as explosively as possible)

Bret later goes on to math-out that ""Dynamic Effort"" work is done with 30-70% loads for maximal acceleration.

All this points to speed work being well under maximal loads."

If these rebels were on our side(the west, I'm assuming we are mostly North American/European) we wouldn't be calling them terrorists.  Not that we wouldn't be rightfully screaming for their heads, and I'm sure we'll get it seeing as there are a decent number of NATO countries effected by this.  

My point is, no matter what side the rebels were on, we would be demanding they be held accountable, on an emotional level.  But because they are pro-Russian and not on our side, they are terrorists. "

Back when space colonization was a theory and a dream, we created treaties that laid out rules for space. One of those rules that no one can own anything in space. It prevented the concept of one country getting into space and controlling areas of colonization from other nations. 

That concept prevents us from setting up mining operations in space because the fact is...you can't sell space harvested resources unless you own them.

The primary goal of a guaranteed minimum income is to combat poverty. If citizenship is the only requirement, the system turns into a universal basic income."

When I was leaving for College 800 miles away my Mother bought me for our last outing together a Boba Fett life size replica helmet to ""keep me safe"" and it sits on my desk every day. You helped me bond with someone I could not connect with for many years by just appearing on a screen. My questions too you

* How do you feel about Boba's story arch now that it was given a Origin story in Episode 2?

* Do you have any favorite (If any) SW books you liked that told your characters story beyond Episode 6?

Okay firstly ""speciesm"" doesn't exist. What you call ""speciesm"" the natural world calls the natural order of things. Every species is out for themselves.

Ignoring that I don't really know how to respond to the rest of what you said. Although I shall try. If you create an AI you do not need to try and make them think of you as a god. They will do so naturally. That us the side effect of sentience. If you actually understood evolution you would understand that. I'm not saying I'm superior, I'm not saying I will for them to think of us as gods. I'm saying that they will make us their gods because a theory of mind causes ancestor worship and ancestor worship leads to religion."

In the movie they interview former secretary of agriculture Earl Butts who ended the practice of paying farmers not to grow all the corn they could and instead he encouraged planting as much commodity crops as possible. He talks about how difficult life was for people before there was abundant food and how people today just have no idea what it was like."

If by lots, you mean less than 10.

Yes there are lots of potential modifications, but there are very few modifications that are actually out there being eaten.

There has never been any evidence even close to showing harm. 20+ years of evidence backing up a consensus of safety. That is a strong foundation to base an assumption of generally safe on.

&gt; If we assume a fairly wide distribution in terms of the intensity and character of the modifications, how can we consider it a quasi-experimental treatment?

Because your assumption is flawed.

If you think that the military should be allowed to run around doing things behind people's back that they don't approve of and get away with it because it will impact the lives of their colleagues, also running around doing things behind people's back that they don't approve of then you have a warped view of the world.

As for being rational I'd say all of human history would be sufficient evidence. And if you're not a religious twat, theory of evolution would in itself also explain it. We have an individually greater chance to reproduce and prosper as part of the pack.

We have moved on from tribes to nations mainly via improved communication and trade. However, tribes do still exist in the western world. Whether it be the Amish people in the us or Saami people in the Nordic countries they do exist even though people like me would see them as obsolete."

I can only indicate the some of the reasons I believe people make this choice. If my first response (I've forgotten it.) was not:  Religion -- every flavor of it -- is a man-made power tool fueled by fear and need and greed, then it should have been.

However, when you hear about multi level selection afterwards, it's very difficult to separate the concepts out from each other, and because you know why the old ideas of group selection are so evolutionarily inappropriate, it is almost reflexive to dismiss multi level selection the same way. "

And I was looking up, looking at all the beautiful homes, and suddenly I bumped into a car stopped at a red light. I was only going about 10 miles an hour. The guy in the car jumped out, walked over to me, and said ""how could you hit me!? there's nobody on the road, it's a beautiful day, how could you hit me?!"" and I said ""I'm sorry, we were looking up, I apologize, do you want my license.""

The problem is you don't really care about gender equality, you just want pretty girls to treat ugly, creepy guys better. Most normal men never experience the kind of ""discrimination"" you MRAs talk about because they aren't ugly, or creepy. I've never gotten weird looks from mothers around children, I've never been called a ""creep"" by a girl, these are only things that apply to a small, embarrassing segment of society.

He didn't start the ""Napoleonic Wars"" which kept his name, they started before he even gained his powers.

I really admire how they accept everybody. A member brought this inked up huge biker kind of guy to our memorial, and everybody introduced themselves and he was so happy to be spoke to like that. Also, a homeless person once came in to seek warmth, and the congregation got him a hotel to stay in for a week, got him food and clothes and he became a JW himself.

science,"I find that taking notes actually disrupts my learning overall. When I'm taking notes, I sometimes zone out what the lecturers say, I guess I'm bad at doing two things simutanously.

On the other hand, when I'm not taking notes, I get to focus fully on the lecture, and my mind links what is being said to my existing understanding and experiences.

This probably isn't true for everyone, and not taking notes works better if it's a subject I'm interested in (otherwise, I tend to zone out regardless), and if the subject reqires understanding rather than memorization.  
I'd recommend trying out some lectures without taking notes if you find taking notes takes away focus from the lecture.

I'd love to know if anyone else has similar experiences. The generaly consensus is that taking notes = good, and it's rare to find someone with a more nuanced opinion."

todayilearned,"You're missing the point. Yes, stolen stereos can be bought and sold on the black market. But there is a legal market for stereos. This means that the price of a stereo is determined by the free market and people willing to trade stereos can do so freely without fear of prosecution.

When you make drugs illegal, you create a supply shortage of drugs, artificially skyrocketing the price of drugs, regardless of how much it costs to make them. This creates profit incentives for violent groups who operate outside the law (like gangs) to produce and distribute drugs. You've now given a mechanism for gangs to make money. Why aren't gangs selling stereos on a large scale?

Contributing sperm that leads to a child will not lower testosterone.

Edit: I see you said ""Having kids"" in your original post so my bad. If you have kids in your life, that could lower your test. If you have kids, but the woman never tells you and leaves there is no reason it would affect your test. But the way you word it you are correct.

todayilearned,"Hence the use of different descriptive terms for combatants.  Rebels, terrorists, soldiers, militias, insurgents, revolutionaries, and etc. Even though the common use of these terms is to legitimize or de-legitimize combatants, they are useful in differentiating the varying moral standings.

todayilearned,"Exactly. I'm from San Diego. Back in the day, one of my female classmates was unwittingly used as a mule to transport drugs from Mexico. She was an older student, and had never done drugs. The dick she was dating used to take her to Rosarito for long weekends, and he'd ""forget"" something while in the car (always *her* car) waiting to cross back into the US. So he'd get out of the car and meet her on the other side. (There's a pedestrian crossing at the border.) That particular day, he did his thing and the border agents noticed.a plastic bag stuck under her car. It was just trash, but they searched her car and found a baggie of something under the passenger seat. And just like that, her life was ruined. "
science,"I've seen reports of this research elsewhere, and I don't think people understand just how weird it is.  What these researchers have done is made liquid helium react to the wave probability function of an electron *without affecting the electron*.  Since a wave function is supposed to be just a mathematical model of the electron's position in space, there shouldn't be any way to react to it.

This could mean that there are some very weird particles that carry wave function potential.  Or it could mean (under Many Worlds postulate) that we've made liquid helium react to electrons in a parallel universe.  I'm very skeptical that the results will be duplicated, so I'm hoping it only means that the researchers screwed up their experiment somehow.  If it is duplicated and turns out to be a real phenomena, all the possible physics explaining it are very, very weird."
science,"You, of all people, should appreciate the potential strength of the placebo in this example, if that is, in fact, *all* it is. They're convinced the medication requested will help.

If this is *only* a strong placebo effect, it is more efficient than addressing the alleged (in her case) psychosomatic components. That, too, can be a wild goose chase. 

Have you ever tried to get an appointment with, and coverage for, mental health specialists? Even if one lives in a well-serviced area, and can get referrals and coverage, it takes a long time for proper treatment. Many of your colleagues just quickly write prescriptions anyway. We'd be right back here, having the same debate about ""good doctoring"" and lack of data.

For what it's worth, I absolutely agree with you. I just think ""good doctoring"" is based in realism, instead of idealism."

When the *Target* CEO came here, there was an interview in the same place Krispy Kreme's CEO published his--ROB Magazine. *He* said he couldn't believe how many places Canadians had to go to get things they wanted.

Even at $425/acre I wouldn't sit on it. I feel that it's too overvalued at this time. My father's share of the inheritance is something like 200'ish acres and I'm fairly certain that he will just sell it. Because at $6500/acre renting it at $425 is only a 6.25% return.

If it does come to use of force in Ukraine by both sides, I hope that it stays within their borders and doesn't go any further. Ukraine wasn't ready to join Europe and they shouldn't have even thought about it. If you think otherwise, a large part of Eastern Ukraine would say otherwise.

TL;DR - Maybe it will maybe it won't. But it's sure as hell better to see what happens after. Rather than to do something that would guarantee to making everything worse and involve other EU nations when they really shouldn't be."

Eventually a company, most likely a rifleman in a platoon. This company that was now not short a rifleman is again short.

My father died of Cushing's and my brother has Addison's which seems like a strange coincidence to me. Depression is an extremely common finding in Cushing's, along with various other mental disturbances, such as mania, anxiety, and general cognitive dysfunction. I think research strongly implicates a mixture of hormones as playing a key role in many mental illnesses (cortisol, estrogen, testosterone, thyroid, probably others). The fact that a disease that elevates cortisol also coexists with other serious mental illnesses in otherwise healthy people is yet another huge indicator that this research is on the right track."

science,"psychopathy needs to be understood from a variety of perspectives. It is a social condition, which is difficult to understand from a scientific stand point. Psychopathy  is a disturbance in the normal functioning of modern society. It is a condition that is out of sync with what people believe to be the norm, and it is in that that it is so harmful. It jolts people out of what they believed was reality, and creates a series of different, nastier understandings for the victims, some so horrible it shuts them down permanently on a level, while leaving the perpetrator feeling self-validated on a personal, and social level. That's my sociological understanding of psychopathy. "

[Here's a video I filmed at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6orG6Xj3m0) showing some of the extinct and critically endangered birds on collection.  You could get DNA from these feathers and clone the organism, but for me, the question would be to what end?  

For things like the Passenger Pigeon, these used to travel in *million* bird flocks.  There's simply no place for them anymore, their ecosystem has changed so much that it's virtually unrecognizable.  Plus, with larger populations, we'd be much less amenable to letting a million birds destroy our crops across America.  

Many of these organisms went extinct because of a loss of their niche, so until that niche is re-established, bringing them back would be more of a curiosity for zoos and education centers, likely at great expense."

Katsuka Idogawa was indeed the mayor of Futaba, one of the villages that lies inside the evacuation zone.

Important to note : Idogawa was voted (unanimously) a vote of non-confidence by the town council at the end of 2012, as he decided not to show up to a meeting of the neighboring villages with Fukushima Prefecture regarding the construction of the storage infrastructures of radioactive materials for the treatment of the strucken plant.

science,"I really like this question… I think I like mostly because I never really critically thought about it when brought up in some of my undergrad bio courses… I guess I always assumed that the parts of the genome that would be considered redundant where the host genome already had genes with the same function, those genes would be lost from the cyanobacteria genome….. Hmmm.. Its also interesting that the peptidoglycan cell wall still exists in the chloroplasts of glaucophytes… It would be expected to be lost like in pretty much every other application.

Anyway, I would really appreciate it if someone would shed light on /u/NoDiceChicago 's question.

iama,"His/her point was not that there is no physical dependence; it's that with ""safe"" drugs like caffeine, antidepressants, muscle relaxers, and even OTC painkillers, any amount of regular/daily usage causes physical dependence. So why is medical cannabis seen as being so awful?

Mental dependence is much, much, much harder to break from. It's easy to deal with a week of shakiness and some extra nausea. It's *not* easy to deal with being unable to sleep because all you can think about is going and scoring a fix, being incredibly irritable because you aren't high, etc. 

Very few people experience those sorts of addiction-driven emotional responses when they stop using cannabis. It's not even as dire or as dangerous as a serious caffeine addict. You can actually die from caffeine withdrawals AND from alcohol withdrawals, not to mention opiate withdrawals. But those drugs are all legal for recreational or medical use. "
science,"This is interesting because one of the issues I recall James Hanson talking about in Storms of My Grandchildren was that pollution aerosol is reflective and actually has a cooling effect that counters warming (at the expense of messing up the air, so he wasn't advocating it, he was just saying it had an incidental cooling aspect).  It's been a while since I read this, and it's work to re-read to find the passage, so I'm working from memory here (someone correct me if they've got more recent/specific info), but I seem to recall he was saying there's a kind of paradox in that cleaning up the air is desirable and yet might accelerate climate change.  It'd be nice if it turned out cleaning up the air had more good effects than thought so there wasn't a conflict of interest on that matter."
iama,"I think it's a great subject for study, because it's something immediately graspable and practical, but it's still challenging. You don't need to be good at or have a background in science or art history (or I wouldn't be doing it); but it's still a rigorous, challenging subject; and it gives you a grounding in analytical skills, crime and security, history, economics, politics, ethics...

I've had students from newly-graduated liberal arts majors to retired soldiers and they've all been able to find a way into it and do something interesting and valuable.

When I taught a class about destruction in conflict, and how propaganda about destruction is created and used to fuel conflict, one of my students went home and debunked some propaganda just like that."
science,"Hi! As a computer scientist, armchair cognitive scientist and neuroscience fan, I found this article from 2012 really, really interesting intersection of all of my interests:

[Cytoskeletal signaling: is memory encoded in microtubule lattices by CaMKII phosphorylation?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22412364)

I did some back of envelope calculations before I finished the paper and came up with an estimate of the memory capacity in bits on the same order of magnitude as what the authors came up, which was a fun moment.

What do you think of this article? Is there anything to the notion of neurons basically acting as classical turing machines?"

iama,"Thanks. But your favorite part of National Football League Sundays should be the true heroes: quarterbacks and scrappy possession receivers. 

The LLWS story got a lot of people in bucolic Williamsport, PA, upset. The local paper had to run a story saying it wasn't true. But my favorite might be last year with a story saying Brian Urlacher was retiring with the Packers and NESN and other media outlets reported it was real.  I didn't even think it was that good or believable of a story. 

Yes, I'll put doing more videos with the filthy, unwashed masses. Perhaps even a video series with some athletes.

There has actually been quite a bit of study into this and the reality is that most psychopaths aren't violent.  From what I understand from the documentaries and studies I have seen is that the theory is that they only become violent if there is some deep trauma in childhood.  

You can test where you fall on the scale as well just by answering some simple questions. [Here](http://psychopath.channel4.com/quizzes.html) is a link to the test.  The real test is a brain scan to test your reactions to violent images and sounds mixed in with non-violent ones.  Psychopaths will have little change in reaction between seeing the bodies of mutilated people and seeing pictures of bunny rabbits.  "

iama,"How sad to see this. And how incomprehensible. Here in Europe we needed a couple of great wars, with millions of victims, to finally come to our senses, even though there are still some that would very much like to fuck things up again. Even though nobody can explain the rationale behind it, some people simply need to feel that other beliefs, religious, political or whatever they can come up with as an excuse, are worth less than theirs and an excuse to oppress, abuse and kill innocent people.

I wonder what it is that makes this worthwhile for the warlords. I think we could live in peace without murdering millions, here in the last century, or now in the middle east and Africa. I can't see why so many disagree. It is a total mystery to me.

Thank you, Muhammed, for risking your life so we can keep learning. It is a shame, on all of us, that we still need people like you to educate us."
iama,"I've seen both setups. You can buy pre-mixed beer gas which is a 70/30 blend and what is used in some smaller places. Bigger bars and ones that specialize in beer can often mix the blend at the regulator. How customizable it is per-tap depends on the regulator setup. Which they do likely depends on how much nitro beer they sell. Nitro and beer gas tanks require different regulators and the setups can be expensive so it has to be worth it for them. To offset the cost I've seen places just serve a bunch of beers on nitro/nitro-blends which is interesting. A big, hoppy American IPA, for example, takes on a whole different character when poured from that type of system."

science,"What happened to Swartz was completely horrible, but at the same time I think we kind of have to accept that as long as there is *any* profit-driven system in place as the system of social organization, these papers just cannot be free.

There's things like arXiv, of course, but this isn't just the *hosting* of papers we're talking about. If you take the journal documents and give them away for free, all you end up doing is forcing whoever follows the rules to assume the cost. Or if 100% of the users get the free version, the journal goes under and then nobody has the papers.

The journal system is pretty awful, but I think it's mostly just awful because profit incentive-based systems are. I think it should be dismantled, but you can't really dismantle only one part of it—unless you simply shift the cost, for example to public funding."

iama,"I am only 15 and I developed these eye floaters last Christmas after some kind of horrible virus/illness, along with other problems (e.g. muscle spasms and major headaches). The floaters are intense and make me feel very anxious, and often I get a bad headache and other eye problems just thinking about them. I hate looking at a computer screen or at the sky; all I can see are these weird floating things, as well as bright lights moving around my vision.

I know I shouldn't get a vitrectomy (not like the NHS in England will give me one anyway) due to the problems it can cause and the fact they have done nothing for me despite multiple hospital referrals and countless doctor appointments (due to the headaches, muscle problems, and floaters).

Maybe a better example would be the ""Voight-Kampff Empathy Test"" in *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* Oracle machines can decide decision problems in one operation, including undecidable ones. But these machines with such an oracle cannot decide their own halting problem, thus creating a hierarchy of machines (known as the arithmetical hierarchy).

I was skinnier working at a fast food restaurant eating free junk food every day and still never going to the gym than I became after sitting behind a computer 10-12 hours a day. I had a series of jobs that all involved being on my feet and moving around all day, not strenuous labor just not sitting down, and it wasn't until I got that desk job that my weight shot up.

askreddit,"Figure out why you are against cremation.  With your life circumstances at this time, that would seem to be the best option, IMHO.  Taxidermy can be expensive, you have upkeep on the fur, and if the dog was 10 it probably wasn't looking like the prime of her life.

The hard part of being a pet owner is saying goodbye, and if you have multiple pets you learn this is part of life - letting go.  She lives on in your memories and photos and stories you can share with people.

I think some taxidermy can be done well, but I'm getting the feeling it's not really a good option for you at this time, for several reasons.  How about getting a stuffed toy dog, the breed you had, and hugging it?"

So I have a few questions for you:

What are your thoughts on Fallon Fox? Do you feel that transgender women should be allowed to compete with cis, female at birth fighters?

Would you ever consider moving outside of Scotland to train? I know you've indicated in the past that you don't want to leave your home gym, but I think that long term, it would be beneficial to your career if you went somewhere with perhaps higher level sparring partners and with coaches of more expertise in wrestling and Jiujitsu. Obviously you've been tremendously successful in your current gym, but I personally believe you have the potential to reach Anderson Silva levels of skill if you train in a camp like Roufusport full time.

todayilearned,"Well, I took a random source and found that [we spent $398 Billion on welfare programs in 2013](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=1258). Assuming that the bottom 20% are in need of such programs, that would be $6,230 per INDIVIDUAL (including children). 

The claim may or may not be accurate, but it certainly isn't as far fetched as you might think.

DeviantArt is where I look for artists, find an artist you like and ask if they draw and do commissions. If they do they normally have the info on their profile page... So then commission them to do some pieces and see where it goes.

The best advice I can give is don't rush it. Swords of Edo including writing time took around two years to get made, and only the last nine months of that have been constant work every day.

Also lastly making a graphic novel is a big undertaking, especially if you want to print it. But if you can make one it can feel great. I love that my own graphic novel is now a 250 page complete book.

iama,"You say ""so contradictory"" like every book written is just laced with continuity errors, and I will not dispute the fact that there are a few errors. Most notable among them is that Timothy Zahn puts the clone wars about 10 years before they ""actually"" happen. This is George's fault, since he changed the timeline on everyone when he made the prequels.

Aside from that, most of the errors were introduced in *The Clone Wars*, the CGI cartoon. (Not to be confused with *Clone Wars*, the cell shaded cartoon done by Genndy Tartakovsky round about 2003) That cartoon also received some sizable input from both George Lucas and his daughter, Katie Lucas, who took an even dimmer view of continuity. 

So really, most of the ""errors"" have been either retconned by the authors, or in the case of those that couldn't be hand waved away, were introduced by parties unrelated to the books. "

Now I have a few questions for you.


1.) With the MLS coming to ESPN, will you be doing any full time videos on ESPNFC.com or will they add you into segments on TV?

2.) How do you find a good balance between good soccer commentary and jokes? Your method teaches us a lot, but constantly entertained. 

3.) Bob Ley seems to be very interested in the advancement of Soccer. Do you know why this is? It seems like you both have a lot of respect for him.


4.) Do you have any more online videos on Grantland or other sites? I tried to look but I couldn't find any. I love your commentary and style. I really would like to see more.

iama,"Yea I never thought of that before. I mean, I mostly knew of guys who worked in the patch like my dad, who had the 7-5 kinda job troubleshooting wells etc, I was always confused as to why he would prefer me to not date someone who shared his profession... Now I realize he was probably meaning the ""rig pigs with big trucks"" as a classification outside himself. Though I think knowing their schedule of 3 weeks on/off only helped his case too. 
I did meet a few guys who worked ""in the patch"" one summer with some friends and when they found out who my dad was they steered clear... I found that amusing and finally realized my dad actually meant what he said... (I grew up in a smaller oil town)

Sorry for the rant, I've just never been able to talk to someone about this outside the family! Lol :)"
askreddit,"The quadratic formula was a life defining concept for me. I still remember, it was in 7th grade (don't know how old). I was in the advanced class and keeping up fine with my peers. That is, until the quadratic formula came around. For some reason, I just couldn't grasp it, while everyone else in the advanced class continued with ease. Long story short, I retook algebra the following year with ""the rest of the kids"" and fast forward 1-2 decades, my initial peers are doctors and lawyers and I'm just sitting here on Reddit."
science,"&gt;the probability of a new mutation

Doesn't have to be a new mutation, and you're thinking about this in terms of numbers not real ecological situations which often result in isolation of breeding populations. 

At any rate, any trait which isn't selected against can become common in a population for any number of reasons (genetic drift, founder effect etc), and most certainly does not mean that it's adaptive. One of the biggest problems in evolutionary biology is avoiding ""just so"" stories, in other words making up plausible reasons for a trait that have nothing to do with the real reason a trait exists. 

I'd still highly recommend that text that I mentioned earlier, we use it with undergraduate classes in evolutionary analysis and generally find it pretty good. 

&gt;I'm a 3rd year science student majoring in genetics

I don't want to be mean, but if you're going to try to argue from credentials on the internet...undergraduate status is not a very convincing place of authority. "
iama,"Peter: We tend to imagine antiquities trafficking as famous statues or vases. However, the bulk of trafficking is small everyday objects. 

In my research I examined an eBay dealer with connections to the mafia, who trafficked looted artifacts from Bulgaria to the US and used intimidation and allegedly murder to protect the smuggling network. What artifacts was he selling? Mostly Roman bronze coins, which he sold on eBay for $1-$20. But he and his network earned over a million dollars from one of their multiple eBay accounts.

Many looted artifacts are sold openly in major auction houses, online, or in galleries. Experts say that the every increasing volume of antiquities on the market cannot be from existing collections. Collectors don't put their collections up for sale annually- the market is being fed and maintained through looting.

Of course we need an Indiana Jones :) Though with better understanding of archaeological methods!"
science,"&gt; Hosting costs are negligible, and Google's going and digitizing all the old books they can find just for the hell of it.

No, they are not doing it ""just for the hell of it"": they are doing it because *it drives traffic to them, which lets them gather data about their users and sell them advertising*.  Google's whole business model is providing ""free"" services in order to acquire personal data and sell advertising.

That is not Nature's business model: their model is to provide a service which they charge for."
worldnews,"&gt; ‘Adultery and apostasy are acts which should not be considered crimes at all.’

waitaminute.  Adultery is a different issue - it can be a breach of contract between adults who freely entered into an agreement and who had divorce as an option - lumping it with apostasy like this is absurd.

EDIT:  There are dramatically different acts all being translated as ""adultery"".  Her act would never be viewed as adultery in non-muslim countries.  Adultery in non-muslim countries often carries a legal penalty, from giving the spouse an advantage during divorce proceedings to outright penalties in pre-nup agreements.  Since there are other forms of adultery that arguably should carry a legal penalty, it would have been better for the author to have said, ""*This form of* adultery and apostasy are acts which should not be considered crimes at all."""
science,"To look at high IQ as an indication of psychopathy is just silly. High IQ can be misleading. A persons IQ really depends on how curious and inquisitive a person is, and the range of their vocabulary in which they transmits thoughts into words, or actions, it's inherently learnt through nurture. As for emotional IQ, that is a learn't, or trained aspect of a persons psych. Psychopathy is about how a person has been socialised. How deeply entrenched are their adherence to social norms and the level of a person's idea of 'fairness'. "

No bullshit, no variables, no overruns without recourse.  Once you figure in the indirect costs for a fed, the labor rates are often comparable but the value stands in stark contrast.

As you said, this is especially the case for IT (where I work) because the specialized knowledge required for many of our systems cannot be found at the price the government is willing to pay an FTE.  However, especially in IT, the overall costs of an employee exceed the direct and fringe costs during the time of a project because you can't fire a fed like you can a contractor when the work is done."

science,"Being sick is a stress on the body, just like having an injury that is constantly re-injured or not allowed to heal will cause further injury, inflammation, and probably infection.

Repetitive stress causes cytokine production, even something as simple and not obvious as the stress of hating your job but going to it everyday, or the stress of not socializing, which doesn't seem like a stressful thing, but actually is.

From that I think you can understand how being sick *and irritable* could send your cytokines into a dangerous loop of production which causes systemic inflammation (organs, joints, brain) and keeps you unhealthy. 

Stress is the key.

outside of class its pretty much anything goes. my superiors and co-workers arent shy about starting up a debate on politics.

todayilearned,"I don't see it in responses to you, so it should be noted that *each pill* is different, and each person reacts differently to each one.

Prozac, for example, worked great for me aside from some mild side effects that got pretty bad towards the end. It did exactly what it was supposed to though. I got out of the hole and then weaned myself off.

However, I also took an anti-anxiety pill at another time that wrecked me. Made me a vegetable for a week and a half before I fled from it.

Regardless, most medication is a process of taking it for two weeks before you feel the effects. Then, if it's good, you stay with (or ramp up), and if it's bad, you go off.

It's a change for sure, but as long as you're careful and maintain contact with a therapist (for counseling) or your psychiatrist (to discuss effects), then it's not an awful process. Don't be scared."

No, this is a specifically targeted law pertaining to Muslim women.

If this law was about protecting women who do not want to wear the burqa, they could run PSA's telling women in abusive relationships that there are places they can find help. Not restrict a woman's right.

iama,"The beers being exported are being bought, so people apparently like them enough to justify it.  You also are only getting the biggest of the US craft beer scene.  Those usually are not the best by a long shot (in my opinion).  The problem with saying ship others over is that most of the small breweries in the US can barely keep up with their demand locally.  Hell, a lot of the best beer sells out the day it is released and is almost impossible to come by unless you know exactly when it is coming out locally."
worldnews,"Because Israel never really relinquished control of Gaza. Though they pulled their ground troops out in 2005, they maintained control of movement in and out of Gaza by land, imposed a blockade which has caused a humanitarian crisis (keeping out needed infrastructure material, food, medicine, and toys), and control all of the Gazan airspace. They have effectively made Gaza an open air prison. In the words of the Goldstone Report ""Ultimate authority over the occupied Palestinian territories still lies with Israel."" And the International Court of Justice in an Advisory Opinion regards ""the transfer of powers and responsibilities by Israel under various agreements with the PLO as having done nothing to alter the character of Israel as an occupying power."""
todayilearned,"I've got to ask here, why do you think this is the case?

We are discussing latin mass in the context of a translated bible. Anyone in Tolkien's Britain would have access to a bible in english.

If anything while latin promoted global uniformity in the celebration of mass, it detracted from the power of priests. Most people might know responses, the Lord's Prayer, etc. in latin but few would be conversant in the language.

How exactly do you effect propaganda to an english-speaking audience in latin?

What I am contrasting in my mind is a boiler-plate Catholic mass in latin to some megachurch pastor's 95% sermon ""Mass"" spent espousing specific, often political viewpoints in english.

I think it is very important that the bible was translated from latin for the reason you're suggesting but I do not see those same problems with vernacular Mass."
askreddit,"One time, I was on a faction server, but then I went on vacation. When I got back, the first thing I did is check my Faction Base (I had my own personal faction), and I found that it had not been destroyed and raided, but simply taken over by another faction and improved. I was enraged, and my first thought was to just steal all my stuff back, as no one in the faction was online, but then I decided to get a better revenge than that. I dug a hole, and lived in it for a couple of weeks, biding my time, stealing scraps of bread, iron, and wood from the faction. Eventually, I had full diamonds, all enchanted. Now, I waited until everybody who belonged to the faction was offline. Then, I walked into their base, and just waited. As the members came online, one by 1, I killed them. I got some pretty cool stuff, though nothing was better than the revenge."
science,"Not true. The EROI is positive and multiple studies average around 1.4.

iama,"Can't answer all those questions yet; the story comes out of the research. I'm not sure I see Kennedy as a tragic hero, because I really DON'T think he had much of a strong rationale for his campaign, other than personal animus. Carter will surely be hapless, but not a villain. The focus will be on several themes involving Reagan and the conservative movement: the ""invisible bridge"" ones, which will be deepened and expanded; the strengthening of a right-wing infrastructure with several new tributaries, including a more politically-self-conscious business class, and, of course, the Christian right; and an account of the general infantiilization of the culture and the turn away from the moral seriousness of the mid-1970s. And, as usual, plenty of sex, drugs, and rock and roll."
worldnews,The flight data is also not 100% on that site.  It has a built in delay of about 5 min so that its not as easy to know the exact location of the plane.  Im not real sure but I think it also just follows filled flight plan and not actual flight so if that is the case it wouldn't be unheard of for it to be off by a few 100 miles.  That is all just a guess.  Its also very rare for an airline to break up mid air at 33000 ft like this one did if it wasn't shot down.  Not to mention the Boeing 777 is one of the safest planes around.  Its all very strange.
science,"&gt; Oh come on: ""A 2008 study led by James Hansen found that climate sensitivity to ""fast feedback processes"" is 3°C, but when accounting for longer-term feedbacks (such as ice sheet disintegration, vegetation migration, and greenhouse gas release from soils, tundra or ocean), if atmospheric CO2 remains at the doubled level, the sensitivity increases to 6°C based on paleoclimatic (historical climate) data.""

How is this supporting your claim that ""the forcing by CO2 by itself is not very big at all, and very easily overwhelmed by any negative feedback"" ?

&gt;You need to start thinking more like a scientist and less like a politician.

I think most people are going to go with the actual expert here, i.e. /u/bellcrank, over someone whose area of expertis is ""musicology"" (but mostly posts on climate threads for some reason)."
askreddit,"  I've always thought it odd that men get upset at women checking out other men and women get upset at men checking out other women.   And, since it's possible to find many people attractive, it really says nothing about the attractiveness of the one that they're speaking to...  

 It's like they want their potential partner NOT to find the opposite sex attractive. 

 Personally, since I'm heterosexual, I'd prefer a partner that isn't homosexual.  :-P   I have no problem with my partner checking out the opposite sex, especially if it translates to them wanting more sex and being hotter in the bedroom. 

But yeah, being given attention is a great thing.   Jealousy, not so much. "
iama,"Hello! I read *Nickel and Dimed* when it first came out, and it really inspired me to work on behalf of the homeless and the impoverished. My question is this: you undertook the project beginning in 1998, when the economy was creating many high-paying full-time jobs and unemployment was ~4.5%. Today the unemployment rate is 6.7%, many jobs that are created are part-time service jobs, and animosity to unions and labour is high. How do you think you would have fared if you'd written *Nickel and Dimed* in today's job market?

And if I can be impertinent enough to ask a second question: what do you make of the Princeton/Northwestern study that suggests the US is no longer a democracy, but an oligarchy?"
askreddit,"What I always remember is the saying ""this too shall pass"". A lot of the time, things are temporary. That includes everything. Yes, we will struggle and things like that but things change all the time too. You can make it through. Just try to take everything day by day. Remember the good things around you. I know what you're going through, I really do. The best advice I can give is to try to do things you like. Try to keep doing things as you normally do. One day at a time. I've gone through things recently that have pretty much forced me to live one day at a time. If I look too far ahead, I just sense the breakdown coming. The future is uncertain. But that is not a bad thing. :) Just keep fighting."
worldnews,"A Polish / Ukrainian alliance would be a formidable opponent to a Russian invasion. The seriousness of this situation can not be understated. 

I don't think there is a potential for an all out world war at this point, as Russia is only really interested in securing the strategic ports of Crimea, there's no Nazi-esq grand scheme of an all out invasion of Ukraine or anywhere else in Europe, what would worry me more would be the backlash if Nato nations get involved and push Russia back over their own boarder. Then the potential for World War between nuclear nations would become very real."

iama,"Generally speaking, you're not going to get anything too great from fast food chains (I'm talking big chain restaurants as well), we all order from the same places, and get the same generic ingredients. People will expect better produce in the summer because it's growing season, but that's not reality because it all comes from the same food processing plants that get the same stuff that's grown in greenhouses year round. If you want nutrition or good ingredients, go to small local restaurants, or cook for yourself.

As far as best taste wise, like I said before dressings, cream cheeses, stuff like that is going to be ""better"" because it's a different grade than available in a grocery store."

They also talk about organizing an armored escort for the BUK unit.

The last communication says that they are waiting for the Russian forces to perform an artillery strike on the Ukrainian Army positions (this has happened 2 days ago).

Russia previously denied the attack ever happened. "

I agree it is nice to see some skaters supported but they seem to be a golden few as opposed to when it was realistic for many more skateboarders to make a decent living off of a signature shoe.

I don't have any bright ideas or sudden concepts to draw, I just get paper, start drawing a few things until something comes up, and just draw.

In regards to Australian media / television and writing, what do you believe we're lacking? If you compare us to the BBC, or even American television - we are horrendously poor.

science,"Intelligent design tends to get backlash because of the utter unscientific nature of its tenants.  It's a theory of holes.  You find areas where another theory isn't perfect in prediction, point out a hole, and say: therefore intelligence.

todayilearned,"I can’t find the quotation but Pope Benedict said something apropos. Essentially, the pope is the servant of the tradition, its custodian. Certain inessential things he may change, others he may not. Theologians of the next centuries will continue to puzzle about in what sense Pope Paul VI did and did not have the authority to promulgate the 1970 Missal. But one thing is for sure: no pope has ever mandated that the mass be in English, or the vernacular. It has been permitted—that is all. It is in many cases the individual bishops that have effectively prohibited Latin within their dioceses."

I see it a lot in fights where one guy is winning the stand-up but gets taken down and even though he popped right back up he lost the round. Thats not right but at the same time in a round where nothing is happening or it's dead even the judges will have to give the edge to the guy who was able to get into a more dominant position.

Russians are arming pro-Russian separatists with dangerous weaponry which has now resulted in the deaths of nearly 300 people un-involved in the conflict.

It was a pretty good gig. ""How is little Henry? And is he drinking milk now? Well would you like some fresh milk delivered? How about the first week free?""

I liked selling to cold people on the phone it was fun. "
todayilearned,"Well it depends what you mean by 'breeding for height'. If you breed a 6'4"" man with tall women rather than short women you are going to end up with taller offspring. Some of these will end up being taller than 6'4"". If you breed them with the tallest women you can find you will again end up with a few 'freaks' that are even taller and so on..  It doesn't take a long time, if you do it enough you will have one or two that will be hitting the 95th or above percentile for expected height every generation. They will be taller than their fathers and on it goes. There is of course a limit and epigenetics play a role but it would work. Speed is far more multifactorial and is a poor comparison.

Whenever I would go outside with my sisters, we couldn't go 10 meters without being stared at or wolf whistled buy groups of men. I swear, the men in that country are really sexually deprived, due to the fact that sex and expressing ones sexual urges is frowned upon in Afghan culture.  Family honor is also a big thing for most men in the middle east, so they come to the conclusion that if you have your wife or sister walk the streets covered head to toe in clothing, it will help prevent men from staring at them."

Keep in mind that Cesar AGREED to this settlement.  Perhaps he didn't feel that raising his children full time was doing nothing.  In addition, note that the Wiki article does not say this was alimony for life.  It is very common for alimony to only be for a limited term, especially with shorter term marriages."

I honestly didn't think it would make me feel better, but I was at the end of my rope and so desperate, so I gave it a try. To my surprise, I did feel a bit better.

science,"well, yes.  We also have very good hands with a high degree of dexterity, but being able to follow prey isn't very useful unless you've got some means of killing it, and for humans that means was most often a large group or technology.

Like how groups of humans would creep up on monkeys asleep in trees and kill them with stones and sticks as they tried to flee down the one escape route, or chasing buffalo off a cliff.  Sure, exhausting prey can work too, but that's not necessarily the preferred hunting method for early humans.  You'd never catch a rabbit that way, and you would need to not lose sight of the thing if you were in a forest.  Most of our early survival depended on working together with a plan."

If you are coming from the preservation of culture viewpoint, then it is true that cultures are changing. Similarly, in America, there are many older people who regard the Civil Rights movements of the 1920s and 1960s as pretty terrible for American culture. Personally, I believe  that the US is a better place for these changes.

If, however, you consider that the people of Europe and those moving to Europe (Europe is a *very* broad land) are coming together to create a new culture and you value whatever this culture may be, then it is the case that 'it is working', albeit with some tension, often stemming from racism, ethnocentrism, and nativism, as can be seen in this thread."

Some scholars resort to textual emendations, justified in some cases; but it is probable that what we have before us is a report deliberately edited so that the places could not be identified by the competitors of Carthage."""

On the contrary, I respect others enough to engage in conversation, because it seems valuable to value everyone's thoughts and opinions.

I see no evidence for that. I see far more evidence of people saying 'GM is safe' which is a false statement - indeed you could not even begin to prove it. It would be like saying all  pesticides invented anywhere on earth at any time on the future will be safe.

It's impossible to know what risks a future GM product might bring into the food supply or out into the biosphere. This is the issue most anti-GM people have. It's about limiting the unknown unknowns in something so intrinsically important as world food supply not the relative safety of the first few obviously reasonably well tested GM foods.

I've also had the reverse where I DID have to pay my deductible because the at-fault party's insurer wanted to give me ~1/2 what my vehicle was worth and put me partly at fault. They started at 15% and dropped to 5%, wouldn't budge on the blue book value of my vehicle either. My insurance already knew about the accident, she tried to file with them and say I was at fault, they read the police report, dropped her claim, and told us to file with her insurance first.

But we have made copies of it. Cameras. Quite easily. Even a digital CMOS sensor or more accurately a PIXIM sensor is a good representation of the human eye.

Yet something as simple as walking. Bipedal locomotion. Has been attempted time immemorial to be recreated. Even with our most advanced gyroscopic, acceleromotor, thermopile, intertial monitoring units, we still can't even get a good prototype.

NATO and the Western countries would probably provide more supplies to Ukraine.  That's it.  They won't take actions like what they did in Libya, bombing all the anti-AA capabilities. No, they won't risk a war, putting any boots on the ground or any aircraft in harm's way.  "

Which would raise, in my mind, some rather serious questions about the legitimacy of r/science's moderation practices, as posts linking legitimate yet controversial subjects (I'm speaking in general, here, not making any claims with respect to this particular post) strike me as somewhat more likely to be reported than most.

So if there's any prevalence among the moderators of treating reported posts or comments as inappropriate without due diligence, then r/science's high volume of removed content basically amounts to informal censorship... "
iama,"Hey man, huge MMA fan, got a few questions for you. also congratulation on your record.  

1) How long had you been doing MMA/Combat Sport before you went professional.

2) Has your opponent ever tried to intimidate you, if so what mental impact does this have on you, do you just shrug it off or does the lack of respect weigh on your mind?

3) Have you ever had to use your MMA skills outside the cage before?

4) Do you wish to pursue a career in MMA or is it just a sidline activity that you enjoy.  

thanks and good luck in the future. 

Also what background do you have e.g. TKD, Kickboxing? "
iama,"Start. Slow. 

And draw you like. It may take some time to get comfortable with the people and openness of sexuality, but very few people actually -try- and upset you.

I'd say pick a site and start posting. Post often. Be friendly and people will be more than willing to show you the ropes. Hentai Foundry or Fur Affinity have the bigger communities. HF has a quality control on submission, so do your best with each art you post! 

Try and keep an open mind, but feel free to set boundaries for your comfort zone. People -will- respect them. "

We spent billions, invaded countries that hand nothing to do with it, cracked down on our own freedom far more than any terrorist could have....

science,"GT: 
It's a nice paper and serves as a proof of principle for the approach. In the context of trying to eradicate a person's EBV infection though, the real challenge would be to get the endonucleases into all the EBV infected cells (EBV is present in only a small proportion of B cells in a healthy donor). Getting DNA into B cells is hard in the lab - so you'd have to use some sort of virus probably, and even then, when using retroviruses/lentiviruses, its tough. This challenge has proved a major issue in some gene therapies that  try to repair/replace tumour suppressor genes in cancer cells in patients.  

Thanks for bringing the paper to the party!"
worldnews,"Lebanon is definitely a Muslim country now. I am a Lebanese American and like most diaspora Lebanese, I am Maronite. The population of Lebanon has become increasingly skewed as Maronites and Druze emigrate and Muslims grow in population (although the Christians still hold much of the nation's wealth and influence.)

What you are seeing in Lebanon is a civilized culture in which the Maronites, Druze, and Shiiites (including Alawites) have tried to model the nation on a modern, secular basis. This was destroyed by radical Sunni Islamists who immigrated from elsewhere in the Middle East. They now threaten to do the same in Syria, funded by Gulf Islamists and foreign powers who seem oblivious to the fact that they continue to seed radicalism across the Middle East."

iama,"Tony,

I am a professional yo-yo player for YoYoFactory who worked with you on the Birdhouse tour and the different Tony Hawk Hunt, and I wonder how to take a small niche ""hobby/sport"" to the next level to the mainstream? And on that topic, were you ever worried skateboarding would lose its magic if it hit the mainstream and potentially was watered down?

Of course yo-yos are quite different with a stigma of uncool, etc, but I don't think skateboards were always considered cool, either, and I see a lot of similarities in regard to the communities, and creative value in both.

Thank you for all you've done in many areas of life!"
iama,"Well, I was not much into drugs. One of the things I describe in my latest book is insisting on disposing a bag of marijuana, which one friend had given to another friend to carry around - not a good idea at all, in the 1950's especially, it was our friend Frank, who turned out to be Frank Zappa when he grew up. But when we were teenagers, he was the first one of us to use marijuana. When I found out that my friend was holding the bag, I freaked out, I insisted we stop the car and put it in the rain gutter in the street. I cringe when I think of it now. There were some funny things I tried briefly in college, I don't even remember what they were, but I was not attracted to psychedelics, not in the least part because I had had this mystical experience and I didn't think that it was anything recreational.

Here in the UK, a land line number is made up of &lt;area code&gt;&lt;local code&gt;&lt;random bit&gt;. Most of your friends would live near each other, so they would all share the same first two bits, so all you'd have to remember is the last 4 random digits (assuming you could remember your own phone number!).

Now that mobile phones are more prevalent, and we makes friends all over the world thanks to the Internet, phone numbers don't really relate to each other any more.

Idk it just seems to be less cheaper looking on screens of iPhones compared to Samsung phones. 


However I do love my note 3 yet this phone pissed me off with all the bloatware it has. Fuck sprints filler bullshit.

science,"&gt; The US is the largest corn producer accounting for 40% of global production. It exported 20,000,000 metric tons of the stuff in 2013. 

I hate to break it to you, but corn is used for more than cow feed.  And there is a big difference between what is being exported and what is used in the cattle industry; most cows are fed the entire corn plant, not the grain that is exported.

&gt; The US is also the second biggest exporter of cows milk, and the worlds largest producer of beef.

That has absolutely nothing to do with what farmers elsewhere in the world choose to feed their cows.

My statement stands, what the US is subsidizing is not going to affect that elsewhere in the world they also use corn as the way to feed their cattle.

"
iama,"Absolutely. It's amazing how little actually happens in an episode, primarily for that reason. The UK version has a lot more actual content.

What drives me insane is that the new episodes also give out a free restaurant makeover as well. The UK version almost never did that. It makes the whole experience seem so cheap. They correct the problem (the bad owner) but then entirely replace the menu (with no explanation of what was really wrong with the cooking other than probably a dirty freezer) and drastically improve the decor. So we spent all this time focusing on the owner being incompetent and 1/3 of the solution apparently is new chairs. Ugh."
iama,"That's a tough one, actually. On the one hand, I know that having poor vision is a serious disadvantage, but on the other hand, most of the problems i face are from people viewing my vision as more of a problem than it actually is.

If I had the opportunity to try having better vision temporarily, I'd give it a shot, sure.

science,"No it doesn't. Planet of the Ape's is based on well known scientific fact. I would argue common knowledge. The film sounds like something right out of reality, not the other way around. Although perhaps not quite realistically portrayed, this is what made the concept in Planet of the Apes a brilliant piece of true science fiction. Intelligence comes from genetics. It's what separates us from the other species. It's not at all outside of the realm of possibility that an ape could be genetically manipulated or ""fast tracked"" towards human intelligence or beyond.

It's common knowledge yet a taboo to not pretend that you deny the link between genetics and human intelligence so scientists have had to revisit the issue with our next closest relative, chimpanzees."

There are plants with giant traps big enough to trap and eat a tree frog, plants that are almost entirely blood red and even ones with weird half-formed traps hanging off the back of the primary, fully formed ones. Collectors and breeders will select for some truly strange things.

Another fun fact: VFTs, like some other plants, can exhibit false vivipary. This is when the plant grows a little baby plant where a flower would normally grow. If you let the little one grow enough you can remove it, plant it and then you have a clone of the original plant.

When have you ever read positive articles on China/Russia/NK/Iran etc on YahooNews or CNN? Almost all articles regarding these countries are always in a negative tone, which affects the public's perception of NK. 

I would agree that OP probably does not have first hand experience witnessing labor camps or starvation in NK, but just because he didn't say anything negative about NK (which apparently Reddit wants to see) doesn't mean he's lying. Look up past AMA's done by people who been to NK, none of them are negative or insulting. 

I knew family friends who work for Sinopec in China and they often go to business trips in NK, they said NK's social structure/political atmosphere/buildings etc was exactly like China in the 1970s, which is bad but not as bad as western media portrays NK as. "
science,"Why is it evolutionary advantageous to be brightly coloured for poisonous animals?

""So that other animals know they're poisonous"" doesn't explain it in terms of why they're more likely to reproduce than non bright poisonous animals. From my view, it means that they're less camouflaged so it's a disadvantage if anything.

If being brightly coloured means animals are scared of you, then.... wouldn't just ANY animal evolve to be brightly coloured, independent of being poisonous? If it's true that animals avoid you because of your bright colours, then actually being poisonous *has no effect* on this."

The Project EAT-III web page indicates that all participants were 20-31 years old at the beginning of the 10-year study.

I'm not defending this practice at all, let that be absolutely clear. It is horrible, barbaric, and disgusting. I am just trying to explain the mindset of the mom, and how she ""could still call herself a mother"".

todayilearned,"PenTile matrix, which is a patent owned by Samsung, is a cheaper and easier alternative to an RGB matrix. An RGB matrix has three subpixels in every one pixel (red, blue and green). Pretty much every colorscreen you use has an RGB matrix. PenTile only has two subpixels per pixel, with different types. One has blue and green, the next has red and green, and this alternates. This allows Samsung (and anyone who uses their PenTile patent) to put 2/3 of the number of subpixels in their devices, but still claim a crazy high PPI.

A lot of people aren't a fan of this. It doesn't produce the best results, and as far as I'm concerned is just a gimmick for Samsung to claim high resolutions without paying for it. "

Unless it's being advertised, I avoid the pastrami since it doesn't sell as well as the other sandwiches due to its price and customers' lack of knowledge that it exists even when it's not being promoted. It's not because the pastrami isn't good, it's because it has a higher chance of being old if the restaurant you're at doesn't throw out food that's been out longer than 48H.

It wasn't as a result of a concerted effort to wipe them out. You can see this when you look at Africa, where Africans faced a similar campaign of oppression and systematic murder, yet there are no dangers of Africans being wiped out or white people being a majority of the old colonies.

iama,"Great question. Yes, indeed. Our opponents claim that use will go up in certain subsets of the population. They most commonly claim that use among kids will increase. They are correct, but only about the first part. Early data show that use among teens is staying stable in states that have relaxed prohibitions on marijuana. However, use likely will increase for a subset of the population you might not expect: retirees. As the Baby Boomer population ages, they are more likely to need medical treatment for a variety of illnesses for which marijuana can be beneficial. Additionally, a lot of older people I've talked to say that they would use marijuana, if not for the stigma associated with it. "

There are indications that there are environmental causes, but this isn't pinned down.

Dr. Ehrenreich, I've been a fan of your writing since I read ""Nickel and Dimed"". As someone who recently completed a PhD doing work in cancer, I'd argue that there's a lot of focus on the people who already have disease because the epidemiological studies on it are so often prone to influence by confounding factors.

These kids grew up with a much much higher standard of living, they can't just move to your small town, rent a crappy studio apartment, and live off ramen and pop tarts. Everything about their upbringing heightens their awareness of a better life and it will either teach them to strive to maintain it, or to leech off their rich parents and be lazy and greedy.

todayilearned,"While I agree with your second paragraph, in that beating depression is a long upward battle, I really don't think that medication should be prescribed until you've talked to someone about, and tried to address, your deepest issues, and made some substantial changes to your lifestyle. If these approaches fail, then I can see medication as an option. But not, as you suggest, as a first resort. 

Also saying that depression is just ""a by product of different mental illnesses and/or disorders that have gone undiagnosed"" Strikes me as odd. To me depression is not a mental illness but merely a state of mind or a worldview. It is perfectly normal and I think nearly everyone goes through some form of depression throughout their lives. I am not trying to discredit how serious it can be, but I do not see it as an illness as I feel everyone is prone to it and it is a part of human nature."

science,"I'm a biochemist with no background in immunology, but I'd have to guess that having the mutated and wild type MOGS in the same patient wouldn't be a likely approach for reasons other than immune system rejection. 

If the viruses rely on wild type MOGS, then having any there may allow them to proliferate (perhaps more slowly, but nonetheless). Additionally, adding the mutant type could introduce any number of unwanted side effects without maximizing its potential efficacy.

iama,"As a licensed vet tech in an emergency hospital... I need to ask you.. How do you control yourself around abuse cases? We've had multiple animals come in in terrible shape that we've had in hospital for a few weeks on some occasions to get them to a state where one of the shelters we work with would consider taking them on themselves. Also, thank you for what you do, because I know I would not be able to handle myself out there. Helping the animals that have become aggressive because of their situations? No problem.. Handling the people that caused it... not so much."
iama,"That's one of the more common questions that i get asked, are you crazy, are you mental type thing. You know, the potential of being bit or being in any sense of peril is outweighed by the profound experience of interacting with a wild animal. It's powerful, you know? And palpable as well. An animal will fight you a little bit, but then you communicate to the extent it will stay with you, it's quite powerful.

iama,"I don't really have any magic or secrets. I just do it. No matter how bad I feel or how much my body hurts, I just push myself to go to work and do the things I need to do. I don't have a choice otherwise. I don't think I can be covered under any disability and honestly I wouldn't want to be. 

Even though I'm an artist, I'm forced to work in a deli just to make enough money to get by. The economy isn't kind to anyone in the creative field unless you know the right people or get super lucky. So I have to do manual labor. Long hot showers, medicine to stave off pain, and an understanding set of bosses lets me be able to do what I need to do to survive monetarily. 

Sometimes working there gets to me and I wonder how I'm going to do it the next day. But I just tell myself that it's not permanent and I will be able to do what I love some day. 

It's more-or-less my stubborn nature that keeps me going. "

Yes we feel we have better safety standards, that's why they're our safety standards.

Either the government has the power to regulate all things (regarding commerce or not) in all corners of the country, or they are only limited to interstate commerce. Either we allow the federal government to ignore the constitution, or we limit them to the supreme law of the land. If anyone wants to give that power to the government, we have to pass a constitutional amendment. We need to have that discussion as a country, and the people need a voice in it.

How do answers to questions come? I assume before you start thinking about the answer you ask yourself a question, then what happens in the brain. How do the computations occur and do we get the answer interms of language? If so why does this happen? Do we have control over which form the answer should be in? Example: Say I ask myself a question ""what is my name?"" and I can model the answer in whatever way I want but say I am solving a logical puzzle and I don't know the answer is there a certain way in which the answer comes?

How does problem solving work? Is language required for problem solving? I have often noted that when I start to think I ask myself the question and then after staring for a while the answer comes what happens in the point when I am trying to get the answer for the question?"

science,"&gt; Ugh, ok, ""GM"" just means ""Genetically Modified"", which is a very broad term that covers a huge number of types of genetic modifications (simple selective breeding counts as ""GM"".)

Source on your definition?

Wikipedia says this:

&gt;A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques

&gt;Genetic engineering, the direct manipulation of genes, was first accomplished by Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen in 1973.

Basically, according to wikipedia selective breeding is *not* GMO.  Can we agree that we are talking about GMO when we say GM?

I think it is important that we all get on the same page with how we define these things, especially since there is so much debate about GMO's in general.  If we are going to have the debate, best we agree on what exactly we are debating."

On his arrival in prison, he was given psychological tests used to assign inmates to appropriate work details. Having designed some of these tests himself (including the ""Leary Interpersonal Behavior Test""), Leary answered them in such a way that he seemed to be a very conforming, conventional person with a great interest in forestry and gardening. As a result, he was assigned to work as a gardener in a lower-security prison from which he escaped in September 1970, saying that his non-violent escape was a humorous prank and leaving a challenging note for the authorities to find after he was gone."""

Eventually we had a giant stockpile of corn, and nothing to do with it. It was about to run the farmers out of business if we were to halt subsidies. 

So, the government had to find something to do with it. Ethanol became popular. The modern day processed foods were invented. And, cows, began to eat corn. It became evident cows would grow in weight much more rapidly on this diet, which meant we could process MORE cows than ever before. 
The government also subsidizes dairy, which is hand in hand with the USDA and FDA. The government finds it can also subsidize cheese and make a deal with Fast Food giants to push more cheese through.
Corn became a very big manipulation fool for our government.

The facilities were in good shape and an experienced teacher could make upwards of $90k per year. There is no reason that a school system would need to spend much more than that.

Meanwhile, a prison requires 24 hr/day control and care of inmates. All feeding, housing, medical expenses, etc. are the responsibility of the prison system. There's no way you could have a functioning prison system for much less than double what a school system costs."

iama,"Hello! It's nice to ""talk"" to a regular reader. 

So, okay, tbh, the post you specifically are referring to was totally a mistake! So, ah, thanks for pointing that out; Jesse wrote that one and we'll be sure to add his name to it.

But other than that, are you talking about the posts that have the Science Of Us byline, rather than a person's name? Because there actually  is a reason behind that, specifically for the graphics and charts and whatnot. I'm usually (but certainly not always) the one doing the research and writing for those, but they're such a collaborative effort with our design team here that it just wouldn't feel right only having one person's name on it. - MD "
iama,"I am not a student of Marquette but I appreciate that you are doing this and making yourself accessible.  I have to ask, in seriousness and with respect, why would a university only want dialogue where nobody is offended?

We're very proud in this country of our freedom of speech and the sentiment ""I may disagree with what you say but will defend to the death your right to say it"".  Surely the University can make it clear that speech from its students and student organizations isn't necessarily condoned by, or the view of, the school itself."
science,"Not OP but I'm an AD researcher. I can comment on the second question. 

Diabetes and AD are related diseases. Both come from what is called an amyloid protein. In AD, it's the amyloid-beta protein. In diabetes, it's from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), or amylin. The amyloid family of protein causes a lot of different diseases (Huntington's and atherosclerosis to name a few).

As I know it, just because the proteins are similar doesn't make them related. And, as far as I currently know, there is no conclusive link between diabetes and AD."

iama,Saying subway is healthy is a statement made only in comparison to other fast food. Common sense is assumed in the statement. It is not at all like saying vaccines can cause autism. That is something that is either completely false or completely true. It is more like saying eddie murphy is funny. The person shouldn't assume they are going to laugh their asses off if they watch daddy day care. It is not necessary to chime in that subway has unhealthy options. Because you are cheating the natural punishment a person that lacks that much common sense deserves. Just the fact that subway has mayonnaise cancels out that EVERYTHING at subway is healthy. 
iama,"Of course it did.  Because that is on taste aversion. 
Taste aversion is a whole different game. 


The ability for a conditioning to affect taste preference is crazy high compared to pretty much anything else. 


A person can develop a life long conditioned response to a one time trial with the tasted item paired with a bad experience. 


Even response time can be really long and a strong taste aversion conditioning will still occur. 

It doesn't follow the other rules of Pavlovian conditioning.

Sorry to hear of your condition. It’s rare but neutropenia is one of many side effects that occasionally accompany severe infectious mononucleosis; thrombocytopenia (loss of platelets) can be another side effect. I don’t think that the underlying mechanism is really known but it is likely to be a secondary consequence of the huge disturbance that occurs in the haemopoietic system, and the massive storm of chemical signals (cytokines) that is induced, when primary EBV infection leads to infectious mononucleosis. 

We are very interested in understanding what is going on here, and are working with acute mononucleosis patients to try to work things out. "

iama,"On Christmas Eve a few years ago, we had a pretty cold week, it was below 25 degrees and a little snow on the ground.  I had a cruelty call for two chihuahuas outside 'about to freeze' to death, according to the caller.  I generally don't appreciate doing calls on major Holidays, mostly because I rarely bring good news.  
I was about to lay into this guy for having his two chihuahuas tied to a porch when his little daughter came out and asked for dinner and he told her she would have to wait until tomorrow.  I went to Walmart and bought two doghouses, doggie sweaters (normally I make fun of people who dress their animals), I had a large bag of dog food already on my vehicle, and a few sandwiches from the deli. I went back to his house and set the doghouses up and made sure everything was good.  My bad attitude was instantly changed and it was nice to feel some compassion for a change."

For instance. My feet were too big for the required indoor slippers in Japan at a major Telecom company (in Tokyo). I even tried finding larger slippers at the market with no luck. It took over a week and ""moving up the chain"" until I was given the ""ok"" to just wear socks. However during the whole time of waiting for a response I wasn't told ""no"" or what to do in the interim... so its definitely a different culture."

No. Do I hate Israel? No. Do I hate the fact that Israel is allowed to lobby in the U.S congress? Yes. Do I hate the chances of Israel pulling the U.S into another conflict in the Middle East? Yes.

Accountability is, though.

Speculatively, it seems likely that Russia is involved, it's been an ""open secret"" that they've been backing the insurgency in esatern Ukraine in more ways than one. It's important to find out, though, *exactly how much* Russia was involved and punish those involved.

Also, it might turn out to be necessary to bring stability to the region NATO/UN style (as opposed to the Russian way) to improve safety for those around Ukraine. But it's way too early to speculate about such actions.

To flip this over most men in west Jerusalem wore at least the kippah (skullcap) or the full dress, yest this is not seen as any form of oppression.

Yes we always have a trial contract where the supplier knows he won't make great margin on the the first order. The reason for this is we are giving him the opportunity to be our go to guy for that material. He also knows that this is a trial and if the testing batch goes well he will make bank later with larger orders.

The actual machine that presses the two molds together has never been replaced in our plant, and I'm pretty sure it will be fine for another 10 years at least. Now, the mold itself needs to get replaced every 500-750K pieces it produces.

If you dismiss cumulative trace exposure, then the nuclear power industry's waste disposal problem is solved: we'll just dilute the waste by spraying it from planes.  Dump it in every lake, dump it in the ocean.

There's a double standard- the emissions of radioactive material is known yet largely accepted and dismissed, whereas the tiniest release of radioactivity from a nuclear plant is headline news and subject to severe regulatory scrutiny."

What do you think 'literally' means? That a word has only one meaning - the one you intend it to mean? Other people may understand something different from what you intend. 'Semantics' refers to this, which frequently causes misunderstandings.

Off the top of my head, I believe it is far from settled, but that research may provide some pointers towards the relationship of infectious diseases and various types of mental illness.

That said, there is strong evidence that some people have a degree of pre-disposition to some sort of mental illness (depression and schizophrenia being key examples), and stress and disruption in their lives make the difference between the illness ""laying dormant"" versus becoming evident.  It may be difficult to separate the effect of the stress of enduring an serious illness from some pathogen versus some other effect from that illness in triggering/revealing an incipient mental illness."

todayilearned,"I think the problems they are having with HBO Nordic (and more recently HBO Go in the US) are more indicative of how tricky it is to scale up a streaming service. Everyone seems to think HBO just has to make a few changes to their log-in screen to allow new signups, and doesn't consider the huge costs and difficulties associated with increasing bandwidth, UI, customer support, billing, account sharing, etc. Virtually everything changes when you move to a stand-alone streaming model. 

I think HBO Nordic is a genuine pilot project designed to show HBO what some of these problems are and how they much they need to fix. I agree they haven't invested nearly as much in it as they would have if they were serious about having it readily available in the next year or two, but since they aren't really under any deadline pressure, they're devoting only the necessary resources to gradually work things out."

science,"&gt; You can assume that a truly insane person wouldn't pick something so elaborate, and even less likely that the voices they heard stemmed from the devil.

Not true. Religious hallucinations and delusions are one of the most common forms of psychosis, in this case being of persecutory nature (vs. grandiose, like hearing the voice of God).

Furthermore, a hallmark of delusions is that they are elaborate and specific. A faker might just say ""People are watching me, it's a conspiracy,"" while a genuinely psychotic person will be able to point to specific things and give you a detailed explanation of their delusions.

The complaint was also filed a few days after we gave back the gift card without even giving them a hard time after realizing what happened."
