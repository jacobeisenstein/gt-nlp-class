First, according to the National Institute of Health, “the prevalence of smoking is higher among the poor” and “cigarettes are, in fact, disproportionately consumed by the poor.”  Second, according to a 2014 New York Times analysis, data suggests that it is more difficult for poor and working class citizens to stop smoking. The Times states: “since 1997, the smoking rate for adults has fallen 27 percent, but among the poor it has declined just 15 percent.”

hidden,"The short answer is the answer everyone hates to hear: money. Every drug that goes to market has to make enough to cover its own development, plus the development of every failed drug that didn't make it to market. This can be a [pretty hefty sum](http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/02/10/the-truly-staggering-cost-of-inventing-new-drugs/).

Sure, it could be licensed out to generic manufacturers, but the paid royalty would have to return to the company the same amount they would be charging by manufacturing it ""in-house"" (which isn't really in-house anymore: a lot of companies contract out their large scale manufacturing to, well, India).

What you don't know is that there is also a large amount of poverty in that city that you as a tourist would never be allowed to see. There is a lot of poverty and homeless shelters full of abandoned children that the government just doesn't care about. My teacher told us a story of when he went there to adopt a child with a past co worker and walking through the streets he saw everything this student talked about and he even saw a malnourished child standing in a crowded street just start peeing down his leg like nothing out of the ordinary was going on.

China has plenty of reasons for why they're emitting alot nowadays. But that doesn't change the fact they're polluing alot. 

The US has all the geological factors they need, but the politicial and socioeconomical environment is stopping environment issues. Blame your government and the big companies, because clearly they're at fault here. "
hidden,"In this analogy, I kind of thought Starbucks would be Chipotle. Otherwise though I think you hit the nail on the head.

That said, I wish the two chains would recognize that they occupy different niches and stop trying to both do *all the things* for *all the market share*.

So many excuses or maybe it's just people talking but it seems nobody wants to admit that they make less and less effort to look good over the years in a long relationship. It's not genetics, it's not being busy, it's purely mental. You've been in a relationship with someone who says things like ""it doesn't matter what you look like"" etc. And you gain weight because it doesn't matter until you notice it mattering. Not a big deal or reason to get defensive."
hidden,"They note those as common features of the two siblings, but don't tie them back to a cause.  While a single mutation is a likely cause of the whole suite of defects, it is not certain and is not stated in the article.  Maybe I just like to nitpick too much, but another cause is possible.  Maybe mom's a crackhead and all the rest is due to that, with only the virus immunity coming from this mutation.

On a side note, I feel for that family.  If it is all related to the single mutation, the luck of the genetic draw really screwed them over;  it almost has to be a recessive carried by both parents that happened to get doubled up in their first and third child.  By odds alone it should have only been 1 out of 4 kids.

hidden,"Well, first: we will remove an ""abandoned"" post, where the OP isn't answering anything (or only 2 or 3 questions). But we haven't had to do that in a long time. So I am assuming your question is about someone who does answer, but dodges highly-upvoted questions:

It sucks, especially if it is someone that we have worked with to help them set up their AMA.

But, it isn't our place to judge quality; that would be using the ""remove"" function as a super-downvote for the mods. What if *I* think that the person isn't answering well, but other people *do* think the OP is doing a good job? That is what the votes are for. 

We have set rules to ensure that AMAs will be done by someone with something substantive and true to talk about. That's as far as we go. We would encourage users to downvote someone who is really only here to advertise and not interact with the community."
hidden,"I don't think you're helping your cause very much by comparing the lack of testing in GMOs to slate-wiper infectious agents...

People tend to think that passing them is the worst part (coming out of the urethra), but that isn't true. As a matter of fact, that's the easiest part of it.... The painful part is when they travel from the kidney to the bladder. It's like a hot knife is cutting you open. The ureter (tube between kidney and bladder) spasms trying to get the stone thru, and causes the most pain. It's seriously the kind of pain in which all you can do is focus on the pain.

The coffee is weak and bland, and the cream and sugar is waaay off.  Here I need to order a tripletriple or a friggin QUADQUAD to get the same level of cream and sweetness.  So answer me this:

I have long suspected that certain unethical owners are skimming a little bean off the top of a new pack of coffee, and making one whole extra pot of coffee every now and then.  I'm sure its possible, but does a store owner get any real advantage from doing this, like extra cash they don't have to claim back to the franchise?

I also think some places train their staff to always use the small coffee button on the cream and sugar, but I've never seen a machine so I can't confirm thats even a thing.  Do the cream and sugar dispensers have buttons for S/M/L/XL?"

One of the reasons I can tolerate watching Rob Irvine on Restaurant Impossible is because while he does have a very stern demeanor, he doesn't turn into stompy-shouty-man very often.

One of the reasons I *can't* stomach watching something like Restaurant Stakeout is because it feels like the show's selling point is trash. The host blatantly does all he can to get the restaurant owner heated up and ready to explode on someone before turning him loose."

How do you really generalize that study to other GE/GM crops ?

I mean there must be many different crops, some that can be safe, some not, so I imagine there are modification to crops that can be safe, and some not.

Any ELI5 as to how a modification on a gene can change food ? Are there already plenty of known modifications to crops which are already known to be trivial and safe ?

I mean I read a lot of skepticism, but never an explanation on the real science of engineering crops.

I guess I should post that question in the ELI5 sub."

1) Do you have any advice for someone trying to make video movie reviews on Youtube? I'm a dutch reviewer so sending you a video wouldn't really help but I'd love to get some advice on what makes or breaks a good movie reviewer.

2) Lately you've started to review more recent movies that are currently playing in theaters. Is this a trend you want to keep going? Or do you want to combine current, classic and new DVD releases together?

Even if you don't answer I just want to tell you to keep up the great stuff and I look forward to your live tweets during the academy awards next week! Had a blast last year!

My current house has recycling bins for metals, glass, cardboard, and paper (yes, separate). Then there's [biowaste](http://www.hsy.fi/en/wastemanagement/recycling_and_waste_sorting/biowaste/Pages/default.aspx) separately. Aren't these also recycling?

hidden,"I accidentally a word, I browse mobile.  I meant to say, you have no idea how often people are suing your company, and often for bullshit.  A crappy worker gets fired, sues the company, claims discrimination.  It's unfounded, but the company still has to fight it.  Someone gets hurt at work, due to their own negligence, not safety issues, sues.  Etc.  HR protects the company in those situations too, and it protects everyone because if the company loses money over that stuff, everyone loses.  Of course there are companies that fuck up and do shirty things, but there are I would hazard to guess, more frivolous lawsuits than valid ones."
hidden,"Do you have sources on that?

""[The] Second Amendment was regularly interpreted by SCOTUS to Any firearm without a military purpose was illegal"", comes off as hyperbolic, but I'm going to assume you mean that the supreme court had previously made rulings/statements to the effect that the 2nd amendment only protected military firearms.

I have never heard this before, and I'm not trying to be rude, but I think you are mistaken. I'm open to learning something new if you have the resources on it though.

If I recall correctly, however, citizens united did cause the supreme court to ignore precedent though, which was huge as SCOTUS historically *rarely* did so. But it does mean that old rulings don't necessarily dictate future interpretations."
hidden,"Thyroid? Did you mean thymus here? Because that would be like 1000x more relevant to both autoimmunity and immunodeficiency. 

Also, I don't think ""auto immune deficiency"" is what you meant, that's not really a thing. Immunodeficiency can, in some cases, lead to autoimmunity, but autoimmunity in and of itself is not a deficiency, and I've never seen that phrasing ever. 

 Autoimmunity is a mounted immune response to ones own cells, as is the case with Hashimoto Thyreoditis, as you mentioned below. 

Immunodeficiency (or immune deficiency) is a state of diminished immune function for one of various causes. A secondary immunodeficiency through the use of immunosupressants is actually one of the ways that many autoimmune diseases are treated, as they suppress the immune function that is damaging the person's own tissue (along with the rest of the immune system, though)."

I don't know how far anyone is condoning legalization, but my point was drug use is not	a victimless crime. Elimination of the law will eliminate the crime (nullum crimen sine lege) but not the victims.

hidden,"A more fair comparison would be comparing the US to Europe. They're *more* similar in terms of industrial advancement, land area (US is quite a bit larger but that includes the sparsely inhabited Alaska) and population (Europe is far more dense which helps it's CO2 output but in terms on comparison it's about as fair as it can get). That's really the only fair metric.

To put this in perspective, eating disorders such as annorexia can eventually require patients to be force-fed, so that they don't drop dead. The procedure for this doesn't require much specialisation. 

The fact that the military chose an unorthodox alternative method that could also be perceived as anal rape, applied to subjects who were being interrogated, does not seem remotely coincidental."

My favorite classes in school are definitely math and science, but history has always been a very fascinating world, as you can see where people went wrong/right in their decision making/thought process, and learn from it.

hidden,"I don't piss on the seat but I always feel bad when I go into a public restroom to take a dump and end up clogging up the toilet. It's those times where you wait till everyone is gone so you can come out and leave your shame in the stall without anyone knowing it was you. 

Even worse, is when it clogs and it is an auto flush toilet. A few weeks ago I went to the mall and while walking around felt that things were about to go down and rushed to a nearby bathroom. After a rather unpleasant poo I stood up and the toilet auto-flushed and clogged. Crap. I moved a little bit away, wiped, and when I threw the toilet paper into bowl it triggered again and started to overflow. FUCK. Thankfully the restroom wasn't very busy and after a minute of awkwardly standing in the only dry corner of the stall I got myself out of there.

Seriously though, auto toilets are great and all but I hate how sensitive they are &gt;.&lt;"

We also glanced over the history of the more powerful countries in our region (Mexico, Canada). I'm surprised more people don't learn about US history as the US is the only major superpower currently in the world. Maybe in 30 or 40 years we will learn about Australia in American schools along with those other countries. "

hidden,"As far as I know, no one has investigated whether or not PrP interacts with mGluR5 in the absence of abeta. I think this is a very important question because it helps us understand if mGlur5 is part of PrP's normal function, or it is only involved in abeta-prp toxic signalling. If it is part of PrP's normal function, then it suggests that abeta toxicity is due to interaction with PrP, and a subsequent alteration of PrP's normal function. It is not as simple as abeta oligomers blocking the normal function of PrP as PrP knockout mice are viable, but I believe there better understanding these interactions will help us unravel the mechanisms behind abeta toxicity."

hidden,"Personally I thought it hearkened back to the original Cosmos, which did a similar piece near the beginning. In both it was specified that the protagonists used their science as a way to be closer to and understand the glory of God, while being stricken down, not by religion, but by the realities of the time. It was not religion striking down the science in either case, it was men and society. I don't see how it was anti-religious, in my opinion it entices a religious community by showing that science can be seen as a sort of deeper look at God's glory, one that some men would not take. "

Video is from a compilation from 2012 called [Mothers Teaching Daughters How to Suck Cock 11](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3027068/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_8). ('Cause the world needed eleven of those.)

""Mom"" is Yuki Mori, born 26 February 1986. ""Daughter"" is Asia Zo, born 1 June 1987. So ""Mom"" is 460 days older than ""Daughter.""

Also, Yuki Mori is Japanese and Asia Zo is Chinese, and I'm not sure whether the age thing or the ethnicity thing bothers me more."
hidden,"That's interesting, and it would be rude and rash to criticize your work! However it is discussing the markets for Classical art (and icons?) 50 to 40 years ago, not the market for Middle Eastern antiquities in 2014. 

The Cyprus looting took place years before UNESCO and looting were taken seriously. Not only has the market changed, but classical art and icons have always had a far wider constituency than ME stuff. 

People are looting in the ME, but all the evidence points to them being disappointed when they come to sell. If the 'volume of looting is vastly larger than known collections could possibly cover', then there will be a lot of pieces discarded."
hidden,"Agreed.  The response to this AMA currently seems overwhelmingly positive and I am somewhat conflicted about that.  In order to be admitted to Pyongyang University, you have to come from a family with strong favorable ties to the North Korean government.  To me, this is not about helping to bring technological advances to the downtrodden masses.  This is helping to bring technological skills to people with direct ties to a government that holds hundreds of thousands of people in modern day concentration camps.  I could understand wanting to help people who are oppressed by the North Korean government.  Maybe I am missing something but teaching at Pyongyang University is not teaching the oppressed, it is teaching the oppressors."

hidden,"hmmm. I'd have to say that I hate the way that looking so young basically screws my chances of finding a relationship. Wasn't a huge problem when I had no real interest (pre-treatment) but now, it's a real pain in the ass. Also decreases my ability to be taken seriously in a lot of cases.

I have a very weak sense of smell (Hyposmia). I can smell marijuana, for instance (helpful in my line of work) but not most other things.

I have a question for you, though-you said you take androgel, but from the research I've done, it's not very effective for treating hypogonadism. If you can, I'd really recommend seeing a doctor and getting a full diagnosis/prescription."

I mean hell to eat up their hype, I can't help but imagine explorers to the Americas before it was commonly mapped had plenty of naysayers also.

People aren't smart, they see the immediate gains from selling or using drugs as far outweighing the future risks. If you could legislate in a way that removes the immediate gains, or treats the cause and not result. you might solve the problem. 

Currently we use a system the was meant to remove physically dangerous people from society, and treats them, to remove socially dangerous people from society and put them back into society pretty much the same."
hidden,"the russians set their reactors up to be as powerful as possible, our reactors are set up to be as safe as possible.

basically the hotter a russian reactor gets the more power it produces; so shit gets out of hand as soon as something goes wrong, but it makes more power when everything is good.

us reactors are the opposite, the hotter it gets the less it produces; if something goes wrong with the coolant it will keep going at the same level, or even decrease in power ouput.

its like a/c versus d/c electricity, fundamentally the electricity is the same, but the way it is used makes the systems vastly different."

You have any relatives up Cape Breton way by any chance? I ask 'cause...

a) my mother insists that our neighbour is related to you somehow, like he's cousins with your father or something to that effect; and

b) as a fellow Smith from NS, who the fuck knows, we could be related for all I know. It would be pretty distant, mind you, unless by some crazy coincidence you happened to belong to a long-lost branch of the family that moved to the mainland around New Glasgow way back in the 1930s or something, in which case there's a chance we'd be second cousins.

hidden,"No. The leadership is corrupt as well in China. Their lieutenants would get executed if they did a poor job. Corruption is not very common in dictatorships/autocracies, unless the dictators want it or are too lazy to deal with it.

In their view, Western countries polluted and yet their economies grew. So in their view, they should be allowed to pollute as well. 

Unfortunately, while it ""sounds fair"" it will result in the destruction of our environment. They are risking millions of lives for the sake of profits while the leadership is living in the less-polluted areas of China."
hidden,"Do you think that Europe has an infinite capacity to absorb immigrants from the third world? If not, what's the cut off point? Where will they all live? Do they speak the local languages? What skills do they have? There are already 20 million unemployed people in Europe. A lot of these unemployed are highly skilled. If they cant find work, how will these people? Will they need healthcare? Education? How will they pay for food, clothing and other incidentals? Will they need a welfare stipend? Who shall pay for all this?

As things stand, non EU immigrants in Europe have a 21.5% unemployment. Perhaps it's best if we don't continue to add to that figure.

hidden,"As a rightie, when you write, your hand is below the line because that is the most natural way for you to write letters. For lefties, the most natural way to write is with their hands over the line. (It's basically because that is the only way to see the letters and words as you write. Try imitating how it would be to write with your left hand below the line and you'll see what I mean.) 

Practically, what this means is that a leftie's hand is constantly being scraped across the freshly written text above every time they write out a new line below. Since ink doesn't fully dry and/or slightly comes off when you rub it, the part of the hand being dragged along the page (opposite side of the hand from the thumb) picks up a nice blueish tint the more you write. It's extremely annoying. "
hidden,"A person cannot be entirely held responsible for their own actions if they are not mentally capable of making the right actions. Period. That is why we institute and study them. Rehabilitation is a small part. They get the help they need, are removed from society, and so we all benefit.

Think about it this way: we don't ever hold children, cats, dogs, etc. accountable for their offending actions. They do not know any better. Neither do the criminally insane/mentally ill. When a dog shits on the carpet do you hold a trial for him? No, you just clean up after him. When a child (lets say a toddler) hits his playmate, do we hold a trial in order to convict of assault? No.

These people are essentially children, dogs, cats, in the sense that they just do not know any better.
I hope that enlightens.

hidden,"^ I pointed out to you why it is impossible for IQ to follow a normal distribution: IQ is bounded on the lower end and so will not perfectly fit a normal distribution. There is also bound to be skew (with long positive-side tail likely), making the fitting less exact.  Sure you can make approximations(under the conditions of the central limit theorem, practically any dataset will follow normal distribution around the mean), but that still means the original statement is wrong. Average doesn't mean 50% of the people are below it, median does.  "

There would be weeks where I didn't drink a drop of tap water.

edit: Went through the article for further information and nearly everyone that had complications from caffeine either had a previously existing heart condition/caffeine sensitivity or drank beyond extreme amounts of caffeinated drinks. I drank too much pop but never got ""jitters"" or anything of the sort nor did I drink beyond what I was thirsty for.

hidden,"Well anything is toxic at a high enough dose. Glyphosate is safer at a much higher concentration than many other herbicides and breaks down pretty rapidly in the environment. My guess would be that the levels the consumer would be exposed to are insignificant but I haven't studied it in great detail. 

Believe it or not the US (and many other countries) government actually does regulate this stuff pretty heavily and there is a lot of research that goes into what gets used and at what levels it is safe."
hidden,"It took a lot of practice. I actually have a little story: I was in the Caribbean one summer when I was 16 with my friend Holly, and we went on this, like, crazy, somewhat dangerous adventure to find some weed, and we went up the island to try to find it, and we were really stupid, but the islanders were nice, and we got dropped off on a beach miles away from our hotel by a sketchy cab driver, and the whole time I was telling everybody ""once we get the weed, I can roll a joint"" but I didn't really know how. A part of me, didn't know if we'd get it. And so we are on the beach, it's windy, and everybody's like ""OK, we are here after this whole trek, how's that joint coming"" and it was not happening. From that point onwards, I decided I would know how to roll a joint. So I would just practice all the time. ~Alia"
hidden,"I played with them a lot as a kid, and nothing ever happened. It was after we moved to a new house, and some neighbor kids told me that it was haunted, so we all decided to give it a try (or several tries, rather). I did occasionally get ominous feelings in that house, and that's what really prompted me to want to give it a shot. That, and the fact that I have always been in the ""sceptic who wants to believe"" camp.

Mostly, nothing happened. Occasionally, we'd get some eerie responses, and everyone would claim that they didn't move the triangle, but I never really got a paranormal vibe from any of it. I just figured maybe someone was moving it without realizing it. It's pretty bogus IMO."
hidden,"&gt;Note that these procedures are done on children, not on infants.

Actually much like male circumcision it depends on the custom. Some are done on newborns others wait until puberty.

That rest of your points alter very little. All that proves is that the consequences of both are different. That was never disputed by my view point however and this does not alter the ethical reasons against either such as

1) Removal of consent 

2) Denying bodily autonomy

3) Lack of beneficial health effects (and yes those health benefits you put up are not to be considered health benefits as you can get them from non-surgical interventions such as washing and safe sex)

All these ethical points remain the same in both (routine) male and female circumcisions making them both equally wrong."
hidden,"Why did I get asked specifically about a woman I know nothing about?  Why wasn't I asked about *people* I know nothing about, since I extend that projection to others I've heard of?

Simple.  Because people are often hasty to judge women, even on matters that are none of their business.  Do I have to cite any news stories as proof?  So, it's implicit in somebody taking the time to call me out in a tone that isn't really appropriate to the topic.  

And yes, I am projecting based upon knowing one thing about the person who did the leaving and exactly one thing about the person who was left.  Did I not admit that explicitly enough? It's not a baseless projection though.  It has a pretty well-founded base."
hidden,"I always liked JRRT, but have found the works of GRRM to be much more interesting and enjoyable.

The theme of internal conflict that truly defines the human experience is just so well-captured from so many different viewpoints in A Song of Ice and Fire; each chapter (perspective from a given character) truly feels like you're reading from the perspective of another person.  Sometimes a child, sometimes an Imp : )

The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.

When it was originally constructed it measured different things than it did today (especially in Australia).
Also following the realisation that communism, left anarchism, etc. don't work the entire theoretical spectrum has shifted right anyway. 

I prefer to think of libs as being more like the moneyed people who think that they have the assets and the belief that they can and should convince people that their opinions are correct (and may or may not be) and implement them regardless of general opinion (because they are better/smarter/etc. than the general pop.

The upwardly mobile people who influence and use the general opinion of the population to gain or retain power (populism) regardless of what they personally actually believe.

My cousin who I grew up with and is like my brother is currently dealing with this exact problem. Just because of what I said may seem cruel doesn't mean I don't have anyone close to me dealing with addiction.


Edit: don't forget these people made the choice to shoot up. No one forced them to shoot up. Maybe in some cases but the overall point remains. As close as my cousin is to me he made his choice and he still chooses to do drugs. If he kills himself over it I would not take pity on him. For as much as it pains me to see him struggle and as much as I hope the best for him and hope he gets better. His own actions, not anyone else's lead to that decision."

One day I do hope to move up to NCAA, basically, you are still apart of TASO but you are also apart of the, oh for fun lets say, Big 12 group of officials. Which have their own meetings and all of that. Once you make it to the collegiate level there are NFL referee scouts that actually go watch games and make notes of the next group of referees they want to pick up for the NFL. Moving up the ladder takes a lot of knowing the right people and kissing the right ass from what I understand. 


As for rotation, typically you have a main position and you'll work that position most of the time, though doing a different position is not uncommon, especially if you are a back judge or Umpire during varsity games.

hidden,"Do you think our currently model of capitalism based pharma companies hinders development in neurological based disorders? I have tardive dyskisia because a doctor prescribed me reglan and didn't know of the effects and then I found the pharm companies knew about them but downlplayed the risks to make money. They are many successful lawsuits proving this.

If the pharm companies that are supposed to come up with the solutions are too focused on the bottom line, how will the big hard to treat disoders like parkinsons and cancer be cured? 

It's easy to be optimistic when you're  not suffering from major disorders and we all know cures and treatments will come one day, but will they come in 75 to 100 years or in 10 if we just focus our resources and tech and not worry about making shareholders money."

You need to learn how to debate on an issue. Every response you gave me was either exaggeration, assumption, ridicule, or a purposeful twisting of my words. You don't argue with proper found statements; you argue like a child.

hidden,"When I was 18 a couple of my cousins and I went to this party. I hadn't planned to drink because I was driving. I had two beers and I ask my cousin if she could continue not drinking so she could drive. Then I got shitfaced. We finally pulled up to the house where we were all staying (family get together type thing) and as we are getting out of the car we heard my aunt walk outside.   

I bolted. I had no idea why I was running but I was drunk and my aunt was scary. It's not like I wouldn't eventually have to come home but I was gettin the fuck away from her. Problem is - I only ran so far as the backyard. I ran and DOVE hard as I could under the trampoline. How drunk can you get as an 18 year old? Drunk enough to think you are HIDDEN underneath a trampoline. My aunt casually walked to the backyard and spotted me. She bent down and looked underneath the trampoline. ""Tim...""

miRNA is promiscuous but the literature seems to say it's relatively stable.

CRISPR is pretty complicated and I doubt you will see it as a treatment against acute infection with DNA viruses any time soon. However, treatment with CRISPR against the viral DNA that has been integrated into the genome seems like a pretty promising target. 


These are acting at different levels though. The linked research blocks viral infection and reproduction at the mRNA level (i.e., perhaps even prophylactically or during an acute infection), whereas treatments like HAART in HIV act to suppress an active infection, and whereas a CRISPR therapy would remove the viral DNA from your own genome to significantly degrade your infection.

hidden,"A couple years ago I saw a graph of soybean yields from NC OVTs comparing Roundup-ready vs. Roundup-ready2 varieties that showed no statistical differences. Personally,  have planted some really good RR2 soybean varieties, but they haven't proven to be any better than the RR varieties I'm planting. There are, however, a few outstanding LL soybean varieties in the last few years OVT results that yielded 10-20% better than the RR or RR2 varieties in those years tests.

Frankly, most farmers are convinced that the RR2 was simply so they could continue the RoundUp trait after the original patent runs out, which is this year isn't it.  We are told that no RR soybeans will be available next year, only RR2 varieties are being grown for seed to supply the seed market next year."

High school would be your best senior player. The oldest players are probably the best to pick.

Juniors and higher are your leaders on your team. Not really your best players. You want to make your captain the head of your team. The captain doesn't really need to be respected, because he's just a moderator from the refs to the team.

Captains are not allowed to argue calls or complain. They can ask for clarification on rulings.

hidden,"&gt;But when 53% of the sample group says that women should not have a choice (?!) I find that oppressive. 

I don't really see this as an issue. Every culture has their own standards by which they deem certain states of undress as inappropriate. For example, in my country (USA), a woman walking around in spandex shorts and a sports bra wouldn't get in any trouble. It's standard dress in the summer around here (she might get some looks depending on the situation and what kind of people she's around though). However, if this woman went nude in the summer at a park or something, she would be taken into custody. So a thin piece of spandex and a sports bra is all that really separates her from indecency according to our culture. It's all pretty arbitrary.

Other cultures have stricter dress requirements. It's not bad. It's just different. "

I consider the modern Progressive movement to be far more aligned to Fascism than Socialism (even though there is much overlap).  I consider it truly frightening.

Looked it up, thanks for the tip. Seems to me that tame and domesticated are synonyms, and the act of taming is to change a wild animal (or plant etc) into a non wild or non savage state. Further definitions of both go on to state that to be tame or domesticated, the animal would no longer be a threat to the owner. Now, I've never personally owned a bear, but I feel safe assuming that a wild bear thrown into my apartment wouldn't suddenly make it docile and friendly and safe to stand around. "

He died skateboarding. Literally. He bailed and had a bad landing in the pipe and broke something in his neck. It wasn't his spine, but more so a corroded artery or something (I'm not sure exactly what had happened), anyway, the doctors said through time and age these things harden and become brittle as compared to when you're young and everything's still a bit fresh and flexible in your body.

First it needs to be made to output more energy than is necessary to run it, and then we'd need to obtain an extremely large quantity of Helium-3 for use as fuel.

Or if we were okay with getting there a lot slower (but without sustainable fusion) there's [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Longshot), but it still has the Helium-3 problem. It was supposed to be designed with tech that existed back in the 80's too."
hidden,"Well that’s a very good question. Rick McCallum phoned up when I was in Italy on holiday. He said, “There’s a little bit of time, Jeremy, would you like to play this cameo role as Captain Colton in Revenge of the Sith?” What? Me? He said, “They’ll see your face.” It was a brief cameo role. In Empire I played Lieutenant Sheckil, when I grabbed Carrie Fisher to go into the elevator. It was a small bit, but no one was able to play it because they were filming elsewhere. So, I ended up playing three parts. Maybe those parts are all Boba Fett and you’re actually seeing his face. Could be. "

Originally, their immediate plans were like raising ruckus in the whole Ukraine's Southeast; presumably because of believing their own propaganda too much. But currently, they are thriving to create another puppet self-proclaimed state like Transnistria, Abkhasia, or South Ossetia. Depending on Russia's support, that might work; luckily, they seem to be working real hard to make Russia chicken out."
hidden,"Hello and thank you for doing this session.

I come from a family with mental illness, alzheimers and various mental issues that were undiagnosed or not accurately diagnosed or treated that led to long term stays in the mental hospital from the 1930s to the 1980s for many of the family. I suffer from clinical depression and have since childhood..

How strong is heredity in the passing on of some of these illnesses? Does nature overwhelm nurture where there is a strong family history of various neurological disorders?

I know that my mother's depression and grandmother's schizophrenia influenced their behaviour and impacted my upbringing, but I find it scary to look ahead and see that they both ended up with dementia/alzheimer's disease after a lifetime of mental illness too.

Thoughts?"
hidden,"Hi Jason. Thank you so much for doing this AMA. I'll try to be brief, yet concise. Due to childhood trauma starting at the age of three, I have been diagnosed with PTSD, bipolar 2, chronic depression, etc., etc. I'm 51 years old now and my question is about memory. I have very little memory of my childhood, understandably. My ""memories"" are shaped using the stories of family members and they become a sort of series of photographs of my life, but I have no real memory of those events myself. Additionally, my short-term memory is affected in that I'm unable to recall the people I've met and conversations I've had as little as a month back. It feels as if I'm living in some sort of hellish and perpetual state of amnesia. 

What are your thoughts on childhood trauma, the brain, and memory function? Is it possible to recover any of those lost memories, as well as effectively dealing with short-term memory issues?

Yes, they do terrible things to their own people, but is that a reason to completely shun the entire nation? The only way to break the illusion of dehumanization that both sides of this conflict are guilty of is through familiarity, to show people that we are people just like they are, and vice versa.

Just to be clear, I am not by any means indicating that I support the dynastic control that the Kim family has exerted over this country in the name of communism first, and solely Juche now; neither am I saying that our government is as guilty as theirs of fostering fear and hatred of the other side.

hidden,"See it, one way or another. It's the best movie I've seen in a long time. Flawless in so many ways. I actually wanted to go see a different movie but it had just left the theatre (St Vincent) so I went to see Birdman instead and so glad it worked out that way.

I feel the same way about movies sometimes, just don't want to spend the time... but Birdman is worth making time for. I love PTA  - he's one of my favorite directors if not the favorite - and I'm going to see Inherent Vice  but I really doubt it can match how amazing Birdman was."
hidden,"What the actual fuck was the point of your first sentence? ""I am an atheist, so I'm going to shit on your person views!"" That's remarkably rude, and completely unnecessary. You do not have to ""delude yourself with religion"" to have feel a connection with something more than yourself, and perhaps just MAYBE some people enjoy the feeling of spiritual connection with a concept beyond their imagination? I believe in every god of every pantheon, however I do not accept any religion as being more true than the other, nor do I hold a religion to heart. Grow up, and realize your own world view is just that."
hidden,"Same principle here.  If you play things safe, stay as long as you can.  However, nothing will kick you in the ass faster than getting out completely on your own.  I grew up in Mississippi, in a very backwards and uncultured area.  I couldn't wait to get out on my own, so three months after graduating I moved to Atlanta with $1500 savings with no job prospect or plan of where to live.  Scariest time of my life, but got a job and a roommate in 3 days and suddenly, I was a full adult.  Necessity is the mother of all invention."

hidden,"bazoid answered for me! There are a few rare mutations that cause early onset AD, which does not sound like what your grandfather has and there are a few genes where if you have one particular version (APOE3) than you are predisposed to AD. But basically the biggest risk factor is age and some argue that AD is just an inevitable outcome of brain aging. I don't think this is true because there are clearly ""good"" agers who maintain their cognitive function...we need to figure out if this is because they have ""good"" genes that prevent AD. There are probably environmental factors in general AD but no one good cause has been discovered. "
hidden,"&gt; generations is a terrible way to think about climatic events.

This is not the first time I've seen you lecture a geoscientist about geoscience.  Shouldn't the guy who's actually studied climatic events be the one with the expertise in how to quantify them?  

Or hell, shouldn't the general consensus among geoscientists be a good indicator of how you can quantify and categorize climatalogical systems?  

You always want to boil it down to it being nothing but a stupid statistical trends instead of the underlying physics at work.  Like I said, not the first time you've done this."
hidden,"Nationalistic biases are common. But the USA did play an important role in the war, though perhaps not as much as Hollywood would have you believe. It was a couple of years after England and France declared war on the Nazis (to support Poland), and it was only after they were themselves attacked, but it was necessary that they (and the Soviets) finally join against Germany. England and France had gotten their asses thoroughly kicked by it. The Germans constituted an almost unbelievably formidable force considering their size, fighting outnumbered ten to one, against most of Europe, the USA and Soviet Russia, before finally being defeated.

I know games get heated, I've been on the sidelines for most of my life and I get it. I've sat there yelling at the ref too, but it does nothing for anyone. It just makes me discredit anything you say later on. I honestly feel that conflict handled well between coaches and refs are a good instrument to teach your kids how to hold their tempers in real life situations.

Also I really enjoyed a friendly coach before and after the game. Who will come up shake my hand and bull shit with me. "
hidden,"Background first: According to my family history, schizophrenia runs in the women on my Dad's side. Since 1900, it has skipped a generation, without any breaks. The last woman to have it was my grandmother, meaning if proven patterns continue, I'm next up to bat. It has always surfaced/developed after having children.

What are the likely chances I'll develop schizophrenia? I'm not overly concerned about it, but I find it fascinating that it runs so strongly in my family. Is that normal? Or is schizophrenia not usually genetically linked?"
hidden,"I'm not saying that the correlation is 1, but I am saying it's strong enough to have a positive impact on the population (as with any trait). There aren't too many idiots in investment banking and consulting. Of course, the main advantage to capitalism is that we haven't found a system that's better for that purpose. Communism would do a terrible job of perpetuating desirable traits via natural selection due to its very nature. Anarchy would only favor the brutes and muscle-bound dullards. Enforcing a system of property rights that requires providing tangible value to society to earn your keep (ie capitalism) seems to best fit the bill for this purpose. Is it perfect? Of course not. In addition to intelligence it'll also pick up some stray characteristics like work ethic, greed, social skills, etc. But short of screening people on IQ and enacting genocide on those below a certain bar, capitalism is about the most meritocratic system we've come up with.

hidden,"I think I dislike MSNBC more.

Fox is completely fictional and the hosts are smiling when they deliver the stories. They have hot chicks on there. It's entertaining fiction like pro wrestling.

MSNBC wants to get in on the partisan action too, only for liberals. But they pretend to be serious. They pretend to reveal the actual ""facts"" when they're not facts at all and they know it.

It's like listening to a salesman and a lobbyist.

The salesman is unabashedly misleading you. You know it, he knows it, and he knows you know it. But that's his game and there are no false pretenses.

The lobbyist, on the other hand, wants you to feel like he's giving you actual advice. There's deceit involved. He's guilty of misleading you while pretending that he's not misleading you.

Or, another way to put it would be like this: Fox News is pro wrestling. It's fake and everyone knows it. MSNBC pretends to be the ""legit"" alternative, but it's actually a rigged sport trying to look like a legit sport."
hidden,"I'm autistic (but not a scientist). Autism cannot be ""fixed"". I don't think a ""cure"" will ever be found because it is not a disease. The right therapies may help your daughter function better in a world not made for her, but she will always be autistic.

I've heard of a study done in the UK that found that about 1% of adults meet the criteria for an autism spectrum disorder, although many were not diagnosed when young. I also think that more adults who have traits of autism are having children together, thus leading to more children getting diagnosed as autistic. 

Gut diseases and epilepsy are more common in those with autism than in the general population. I hope that all the research going into studying the genetics of autism will help cure said diseases.

Removing gluten from your daughter's diet may or may not help her. Each autistic person is different and there is no one-size-fits-all in terms of treatments. "
hidden,"Not necessarily. My dad happened to work in an all-female office, and the dynamics were fine. There was a middle-aged mother of 3 who took the younger one in under her wing, and the others just wanted to get shit done. The problems they had were with the suits 2,000 miles away in Kansas City.

On second thought, it might have been my darling dad who was the jerk, but he was the boss so they just rolled their eyes and did what he said. That's probably about as healthy as you can get in terms of work dynamics."

For example, there's rubber stamps for stamping crosses onto cards, stamps with Bible verses, etc and there's iron-on patches for clothing/fabric with crosses. I mean, it is certainly not overwhelming by any means, but around this part of the country it just seemed slightly *odd* that there was anything more than two products with a religious theme. So Hobby Lobby definitely seems completely in-your-face about it, from my view, whereas the JoAnns here (no idea what they're like outside of this region) has a mild selection of products mixed in with other products."

hidden,"(Same response as above) 

We are an LLC (Limited Liability Company.) As an owner, or equity member, there is no ""salary"" but instead, a guaranteed payment. A ""guaranteed payment"" is a regular payments for services rendered by a member.

My guaranteed payment is $120,000 annually. This would be comparable to a salary.

I also make a bonus based off the performance of the company, 10% off net income AFTER guaranteed payments to members (we have 3 members).

Finally, I have my retained earnings, which is proportional to my equity % in the company.

So, if the company does not make money, the only compensation I receive is $120k. However, if cash flow is tight, management will defer their guaranteed payments as a liability on the balance sheet until the company is in a position to pay. This means, the management team could sometimes not choose to pay themselves (even their guaranteed payments) if they feel the company needs to use that cash to maintain operations.

hidden,"&gt;The people knew full fucking well what they were doing and so did the courts. You can't do shit like that, that is why they lost.

Actually, a later decision would have invalidated the decision that lost PETA.org. In those days, domains were first come, first serve. If you bought a domain and kept it in use, and didn't use it for fraudulent purposes, it was yours. So pretending they were actually PETA should have lost the domain, but making a parody of PETA should have been allowed if not for PETA's bullying.

You know the Maggi name? It's ultra-popular in Europe for soup mixes and stuff. Nestle tried to take the Maggi.com domain away from a guy who got it as it was his nickname. But he was rich enough to defend, and they lost at WIPO arbitration. Then they took him to Swiss court, and using their strict trademark law, where one company's trademark supersedes all other considerations, took it from him.

If you wanna get a good idea of what $10 million can really do, play around with this: www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=investment+calculator. I used 35 and 80 for starting and ending ages, and when they live off of half a million a year (which most people would consider wealthy, although not mind-bogglingly so), their wealth still grows. A lot. Half a million is an easily affordable mortgage on an ocean front house in San Pedro and a 7 series BMW. 

I could even get pretty reasonable growth with $1 mil/yr withdrawal, and that's where most people draw the line between ""upper class"" and ""rich""."

1) How are memories formed in people with cognitive disorders? Is there a difference in the amount of time they can be stored for, accuracy, and process?

2) What methods have you used to study these disorders?

Oh yeah, and the Hawaii thing you mention is interesting. That actually applies to almost all of Polynesia: you're talking about sweet potatoes. They were one of the staple crops of the Polynesian peoples-- it was almost to Polynesians like what wheat was to early Europeans. They were grown on most Polynesian islands. It was recently proven (through genetic testing) that sweet potatoes come from South America, which I'm pretty sure means that, at some point, a Pacific people (possibly Polynesian) visited the Americas and acquired the vegetable. Before genetic testing confirmed the plant's origin, there were hints in the similarity between the native Peruvian word for sweet potato (*kumar*) and one of the Polynesian words for it (*kumara*)."

Chances are they targeted the wrong plane, or were erroneously told a transport would be there when there was none. Plane pops on radar and without verification they bring it down. I don't think it was intentional and I don't see any upside for them beyond blaming Kiev. Which is daft, since Ukraine would have no reason to a) target a plane at cruising altitude when the rebels have no access to significant air power and b) would likely have procedures and systems in place to be able to tell authorized commercial flights from unidentified military ones."

Furthermore, there is no single Retina screen. They are found in different sized devices and even have different ppis.

The idea is that shoveling a smaller amount of snow twice is more efficient than shoveling a larger amount of weighted and potentially packed down snow once. It also makes the walkways and sidewalks easier to use. It pretty much has to be a full on blizzard to interrupt the regular snow shoveling routine.

&gt;1795, in specific sense of *""government intimidation during the Reign of Terror in France""* (March 1793-July 1794), from French terrorisme, from Latin terror (see terror).

&gt;**If the basis of a popular government in peacetime is virtue, its basis in a time of revolution is virtue and terror -- virtue, without which terror would be barbaric; and terror, without which virtue would be impotent. [Robespierre, speech in French National Convention, 1794]** 

&gt;General sense of ""systematic use of terror as a policy"" is first recorded in English 1798 (in reference to the Irish Rebellion of that year). At one time, a word for a certain kind of mass-destruction terrorism was dynamitism (1883); and during World War I frightfulness (translating German Schrecklichkeit) was used in Britain for ""deliberate policy of terrorizing enemy non-combatants.""

There are no exceptions for types of system of government."

What people take objection to is that you (and this article) clump those wage earners in with the wealthy. The reality is that people who are working (earning an income) are not wealthy. Those tax numbers referenced in your article are for incomes. The truly wealthy don't gain wealth through income, but through capital gains and other methods which have far lower tax consequences. What income they do make is taxed at the same rates as the rest of us, when it isn't subject to deductions, but they make most of their money in other ways and at a far less tax burden.

Where several people have received these treatments (as is the case with tissue engineered bladders: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16631879 ) the method to grow these organs will be the same between patients, however the cells used to grow them are autologous (the cells used are the patient’s own cells). This is necessary to avoid an immune response, leading to the body rejecting the organ which is seen in traditional organ transplants.

Additionally, if the way they choose a restaurant to feature in the show in the US version is anything like choosing contestants for other US reality shows.. They specifically look for places that have terrible owners because they know there's a greater chance of conflict... which means RATINGS!!

Some health workers will be infected but they will receive excellent care and I doubt there will be deaths.

It will spread to other parts of the world equally easily, and it is those countries with weak health systems that have the most to worry about.

hidden,"&gt;The fundamental nature of poverty is that you are being unfairly exploited by the wealthy and powerful

I'm not really sure this is true.  Certainly the wealthy and powerful have exploited the poor on many occasions.  But you can be poor without being exploited.  For instance, before contact with European colonists, many tribes in Africa or Asia (in, let's say, approximately 1740) were poorer than their European counterparts.  For instance, many Englishmen might have owned books, or guns (anything steel really), had better access to medical care, more food, better houses, etc.

Obviously colonists did exploit the colonized.  My point is that the colonists were still richer *before* the exploitation occurred.  So poverty isn't *always* something that is the fault of some nefarious exploitative wealthy person."

hidden,"It's a shame this hasn't received more attention, because this post is incredibly concise and cuts right to the heart of the matter. 

I'm of the mind that US environmental and workplace regulations should be followed even by US companies abroad, it would go a long way to curbing the destruction and social degradation caused by US corporations, with tariffs being placed on any goods that don't meet US guidelines. Such a policy would foster good will and truly elevate and improve developing nations. But that little suggestion right there may earn me lots of downvotes because it is a very unpopular sentiment on reddit.  "
hidden,"I spent two years in a women's prison for shoplifting. Even though I was guilty and in minimum security, prison was a soul crushing experience that caused major depression and I sill have flashbacks about. I can't imagine what it would have been like to be an innocent person in that situation for eight times the length. I am genuinely sorry you had to go through that and your strength and commitment to justice is admirable.

hidden,"Not when you have political correctness trying to suppress honest discourse. Research like this has big implications for us humans because we are also part of the ""animal kingdom"" and thus subject to natural selection. If this research in Chimpanzees leads us to discover something unusual but politically incorrect about humans it can lead to a lot of problems. We already acknowledge for example that certain skin pigmentations can lead to better protection from the sun's radiation, that the people of Tibet have a genetic mutation that confers them better abilities to function in low oxygen environments, or that Europeans have unusually high rates of lactose tolerance, but bring up possible differences in intelligence and their corollary observation in animals and the next thing you know you are losing funding for your research because it would go up against political correctness."

Still, I'd rather we went the other way. Legalise certain drugs, especially the likes of weed maybe not so much bath salts and PCP that seem to really cause issues.

The register is just a PC with Windows Server 2003 installed on it. I have worked and troubleshooted with that register system waay too many times to count. They are also super expensive too. 

Misrings, voids, etc give this annoying Uh-Oh sound as well. The register has a stupid animated gas station pump as a mascot - kind of like the Microsoft Clippy.

You can turn the sounds off too, which I HIGHLY recommend to my customers. If I had to work at a C-Store with the annoying Passport sounds turned on, I wouldn't be working there."
hidden,"Oh hey, sorry to bog you down with jargon. Let me try to explain it better!

Having both types of MOGS in your system wouldn't necessarily give you the best features of both, in fact it's more likely to give you the worst features. The mutated MOGS will still interfere with a lot of important cell functions, but the viruses will still be able to make copies of itself because the normal variant is also there.

The better strategy may be to shut off the gene that makes MOGS, or develop a drug that deactivates it until the infection has cleared. A drug like that would probably be really dangerous and have lots of side effects, maybe even on par with chemotherapy, so identifying and managing those would also be a big priority."
hidden,"&gt; Stalin found out that his only daughter was dating a filmmaker, and a Jewish one at that, at 16. Stalin was not a vicious anti-Semite (he had Jewish friends, hic), but he had anti-Semitic tendencies, to say the least. Her paramour actually was sent to the GULAG for 10 years. That was one way to break up the relationship. Needless to say, old Svet and her father were not terribly close before that, and less so after that.

It's worth mentioning that at the time of their relationship, when Alliluyeva was 16, **Aleksei Kapler was 40**. And I think *that* had more to do with Stalin's reaction than the fact that he was Jewish."
hidden,"So essentially, the USA likes to blame india and china. 

The rest of the world likes to blame the USA.

No offence but, compared to other developped countries the USA isn't necessarily doing great in terms of renewable energy or emissions. Very high emissions per capita (higher than india and china), compared to the size and resources available rather low renewable energy sources. 

It's hard to listen to americans brag about how they're helping the environment while india and china are so much worse. You're comparing yourself to china and india, in terms of environmentalism, that's not quite the best defence. 

The USA isn't world leader in environmentalism. There is growth and a certain amount of catch-up, but you're still lagging behind several other developped countries. Please get off your high horse.

hidden,"Military stuff did get talked about some, as did some other topics.  Food distribution was not something that I really talked about, maybe it came up more for the agriculture students, though.

For instance, in the spring the understand was that they were at war with the US, there were cars driving around with netting to prevent detection from satellites, and the media reported that there was a US intrusion into the country that the army repelled.  The students would ask the professors why they were still there when their countries were actively at war."
hidden,"I wouldn't say that. I think the majority are actually choosing it for themselves, though I agree that it is clear that there are quite a few cases where that is not the case.

Though she *still* have an abusive husband or family or whatever. She's still not ""free"". Guess what we already have laws in place against physically forcing people to do things against their consent. But I agree, it is indeed harder to stop the psychological abuse. 

I just don't think a ban on the burqa is effective in this instance. I think it's such a tiny little part of the problem, and I think it's more important that we still have the freedom to dress up however we like."

hidden,"Determining the sole cause of the event is impossible because there is never one sole cause.  Droughts do occur without climate change so its impossible and incorrect to say that climate change would cause the event.  You (or the paper) are right about that.

That being said, there's virtually no doubt that increased temperatures brought on by climate change impact these situations to make them worse.  The higher air temperatures are driving evaporation to higher levels which decreases the moisture available in soil, lakes and reservoirs, and virtually every part of the hydrologic cycle.  It also leads to more fire weather conditions (I'd imagine the upcoming fire season for California - and the rest of the SW - is going to be very harsh) so while AGW may not be a cause here it definitely exacerbates the situation."

Not. Even. Panting.

hidden,"I guess it's a question of ease-of-use vs. control of features. Reminds me a bit of Apple vs Android. Inbox, like Apple, takes away some of the control in favor of a very streamlined experience, while Android, like gmail, offers more control with a less streamlined experience. Depends on what's important to you. (My analogy isn't perfect because I like Inbox but use an Android phone, but I think it gets the point across.)

Either way, since switching to Inbox I've unsubscribed from most of the promo emails I used to get that I just deleted instead of unsubscribing from before I switched from gmail. They aren't much of an issue now."

And you think that is the important part of this, what level of Government actually did the spending? Ill give ya a hint, we shouldn't be spending hundreds of millions to equip U.S. counties with the same equipment we used in Iraq, they don't need military equipment just cause they think its cool. U.S. Civilians are not enemy combatants, and local authorities need to stop pretending they are soldiers at the expense of our tax dollars. Seriously, for instance, why does the LAPD need millions in extreme cold weather gear?

Clu may very well have believed that if he didn't act, *everyone* would end up dead. Or he might have been manipulating public perception for his own ends, as he did in other instances. It's hard to know for sure, but I love that ambiguity and what it does for the story.

hidden,"Okay. That comment was used by you as an example as to why we need labeling laws with GMO products. I know you weren't speaking that comment literally.

The point is that example is based off of something that has never happened and never will happen.

No product has ever been genetically modified to where 50% of it's genome is different. Has never been done and will never be done. It isn't a real thing.

So for you to say that and say ""this is why we need GMO labels"" is you misrepresenting the issue and using a bad example. That is my point.

If I said ""we need voter ID laws because terrorists may implant populations in the U.S. and eventually vote to change the constitution.""

A great example of throwing people under the bus is in the United States, where when people think ""poor person"" they mentally picture a black person. Now when a person has issues with black people, they're always corrected, ""No, you don't find black people annoying, you find *poor people* annoying."" So then these people just go on to hate poor people *and* black people. When a terrorist commits a terror attack, it's because they're poor. When people join ISIS, it's because they're poor. Find something morally abhorrent and you can rest assured the PC crowd will find a way to throw poor people under the bus. "

Sure, it would be absolutely possible to grow crops hydroponicly in this fashion, but the cost would be even higher with the current state of technology.

If corn was a $1000 a pound, it would be realistic.

And curious how you feel about industrial indoor farming, the kind WIRED has fantasized and seems very World Of Tomorrow-y where there are skyscrapers of nearly autonomous farms with different floors dedicated to different crops.

Could you speak to any feelings you have toward perma culture at all?

We have a hand reared bull, an Angus, who is the most docile beast I have ever encountered. He'll come up to us when we're branding the new calves, and steering the bull calves, and will just generally chill near us people. 

He's like a massive puppy, even though he's been in our rural (not house) paddock for the last 5 years, he still remembers everyone. 

We've also had hand reared Brahman cattle that are just completely psycho -- we had to sell off one of our bulls because he was killing steers for virtually no reason. Not all Brahman are that bad, but they tend to be a little more standoffish than other breeds I've encountered. 

But definitely -- just approach a beast like you would a dog, slowly, calmly and let the animal inspect you first, before you make any movements.

If you meet the requirements for visa sponsorship, are a qualified candidate, and make it through the interview process, then receiving an offer is a real possibility. Keep in mind timing. You would likely need an H-1B sponsorship and those applications open in April of each year with start dates for the following October. The best time to apply in order to make the window would be in January. Also, the US Government caps the amount of H-1B visas allocated each year and there may be a lottery system used if there are more applications than the amount of visas allotted. I would do some more research on it and if you feel like it is something you would like to try, please don't hesitate to apply!"

hidden,"I'm not a medical expert, so I'll just try to assemble all of the info I've gathered:

The first symptoms of Ebola are very similar to the flu or Malaria. Fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. As it develops, more serious problems begin. Impaired kidney and liver function. In some cases, both internal and external bleeding. Each case is different. Incubation period from when you are infected to when you start showing symptoms is two to 21 days. Doctors consider the first seven to 10 days after infection the peak of the illness. 

If a person is lucky enough, symptoms will start to fade. The body will begins to produce antibodies to fight off the infection. This is the first step of recovering from the virus. 

Some studies have shown that the virus can lay dormant for up to 3 months in breast milk and semen."

Very different from US aviation culture, at least in the Air Force (which contributes a lot to civil aviation). One of the first things a new Air Force aviator learns is ""there is no rank in the airplane"". Everyone is a crew member, and everyone is not only expected to but *required* to assertively challenge unsafe or bad decisions.

Whereas, in the US version, it comes off as though he's just pushing their buttons to get a rise out of them for the sake of a good US promo.

Though, I think a lot of it really is just the difference in editing. The UK version actually focuses a lot more on the help he's providing - while the US version focuses on the berating and yelling of the owner/chef and the remodeling of the entire fucking place. 

Maybe some of that has to do with the fact that he has to rely on actual advice in the UK version, given the limited budget.... While he almost always remodels the entire restaurant and upgrades everything in the kitchens of the US restaurants. "

I think keeping a balance is important though, I'd like to keep myself in check and make sure I'm not spending *too* much time here!  My main supervisor is sort of internet unaware, but Dr. Clark works with me very closely and likes to let us know not to spend TOO much time wastefully, which I completely agree with.  David is on my committee, too.  Reminds me, I need to schedule a meeting!

I don't understand what this has to do with the West anymore. Every time we try and bomb them into submission it makes things worse.

*Colchicine inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to tubulin, one of the main constituents of microtubules. Availability of tubulin is essential to mitosis, and therefore colchicine effectively functions as a ""mitotic poison"" or spindle poison.*

There's been a few studies to show that most people are only buying 1-2 items (generally, coffee) so having 8-10-12+ staff at a given time to service a bunch of 1.50$ transactions is pointless. Given employee pay, over head and material costs, that's not a whole lot of profit.

At the same time, you have to remember that a large part of hte country doesn't look too favorably upon Musharraf, because he ""gave up Pakistan's sovereignty"" and started fighting a proxy war against Al Qaeda on Pakistan's northern borders.

I guess you could e.g. sign the data with a unique per box key that gets destroyed on impact, preventing any tampering after the fact. But since this system must not influence reliability, loss/corruption of the signing key would mean unsigned data to be written. So the attacker could simply present unsigned data claiming that the recorder must have lost the key...

People calling themselves environmentalists and taking part in meat consumption is a problem. The only reason we ""need"" the GMO crops is because of this already unsustainable animal raising. It's a problem caused by a  much bigger problem. I do agree with you on that front about making things worse but it's like comparing a raindrop to a flood as thing stand right now.

First and last movie are business as usual when you build military base in distance from training area. First movie is 18 Motorized Briage going from their bases in Białystok for ""Zielona"" military training area. That region is bordered with Belarus, not Ukraine. Middle movie is civilian train leased to move stuff (notice plenty of cars are civilian, not military). Last movie are guys from 17 Motorized Brigade in Lubuskie (thats opossite side of country BTW than border with Ukraine) going form their base for ""Gryżyce"" military training area.

Stuff like that is common sight near designated military training areas, same as fighters are common sight near air bases.

Also you guys should check out Rosomak's range. That beast drinks too much fuel to make it sense to simply drive it to border."

Because it's not about what's best for America. It's about what's best for the people of Syria. 

America has no interest in doing the right thing. they never have. If toppling a democratic government, or committing genocide is best for America, that's what it does at the expense of whoever is in the way of their interests. This is why everyone hates the U.S. Not ""for our freedom"" 

Syria being a lose lose situation doesn't make it right for the U.S to do whats best for it instead of what's best for the people of Syria. The fact that I have to say that is fucked up."

The reason for this is to protect the person with the dog. If I let person XYZ pet my dog every day when he was working, he might get distracted by seeing that person and wanting to get another head scratch again.

Syndrome
&gt;In medicine and psychology, a syndrome is the association of several clinically recognizable features, signs (observed by someone other than the patient), symptoms (reported by the patient), phenomena or characteristics that often occur together, so that the presence of one or more features alerts the healthcare provider to the possible presence of the others.

I'm not going to say people aren't partially responsible for climate change because that wouldn't be true. And even then, it's not just that people exist is the problem, but rather its the pollution that we create. Even then, we aren't the only reason that the climate is changing. It is likely a combination of factors that are leading to a changing climate on our planet Earth. So while pollution, which many scientists are working hard to reduce, may be a factor in climate change, it is certainly not the only factor.

The only game of yours that I owned for myself was Underground 2 on the original Xbox, which was just a blast to play through.

Onto the questions, I was wondering what was your main inspiration to become a pro-skater, and moreover, why?

Their focus is mainly on being aware of problems that may arise when transferring treatment methods that were developed in Western countries to the developing world/Eastern societies. They pose a significant challenge to the current attitude that a lot of mental illnesses are just illnesses caused by chemical imbalanced, which can be fixed by drugs. So what's your take on those?

hidden,"Integrals are overkill, and in my opinion don't give a whole lot of insight into cones or gemoetry.

You can make a cone out of a circle cut like a pie, and rolled and taped. Using that construction, the surface area is area of the circle times the fraction of it used for the cone (which is retrievable by the circumference of the cone edge divided by the circle circumference: 2pi\*l where l is the distance from the tip to the edge) so you get pi\*l^2 * C/(2pi\*l) = C\*l/2 or pi\*r\*l with r the radius of the cone base.

Though the beauty of math is that there's unlimited ways to find the surface area of a cone and they all converge logically on the same concept.

You could also look at it unrolled analogous to a cylinder just as a triangle is to it's rectangle sharing the base: A=(1/2)b\*h"

Some partners might be more comfortable than others with John's visits to his happy-ending masseuse, and it is all circumstantial, so the boundaries of his relationships (what constitutes ""disloyalty"") should be an ongoing discussion with his partners.

So, to your proposition:

&gt; If you wouldn't tell it to your significant other, it's cheating.

&gt; Even if you discuss it with your SO, it still might be cheating.

In other words, just because you are open about it doesn't necessarily mean that your actions won't be seen as disloyal by others."

hidden,"Haha no, that's not what this is saying. There's a difference between ingesting something and actually getting that compound into your blood stream and transported into cells. Common example: you can actually eat scorpion poison because it's broken down by metabolic processes in your body. Getting it into your blood stream (via a jab from the stinger) and you've got a completely different situation.

The molecule in question here is a micro RNA, or miRNA. Despite being fairly stable for an miRNA, these molecules were never meant to be outside of cells and even inside cells are supposed to be rapidly degraded and unstable. It's extremely unlikely that ingesting honeysuckles would actually provide the benefit outlined in this article."

German submarines were actively sinking american shipping without search or warning, killing american civilians and sailors. And then there was that whole [""trying to convince mexico to invade texas""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmermann_Telegram) thing. 

 If America didn't have any interest in the war in 1914, the Germans worked pretty damn hard to drag them in by 1917...

Saw pictures of myself at the beach during last summer and saw some puffy cheeks and a nice tire the around the waist.   Was always tired in the evenings so I didn't work out and had been eating terrible.   I finally figured it out.   I became a morning person.   Bought myself a pull up bar and started waking up at 4 am before the wife and kid.  That gave me enough time to drink some coffee and do a 30 minute routine before they got up.  I also started cleaning up my diet, little by little.  Dropped 30 pounds of fat and gained some muscles back.  It's very doable but I will admit some serious will power is necessary. "

He taught me from a verrry young age what guns were, and that they were a good thing if used correctly...  He also taught me from a young age that if he ever caught me touching one without him being there, and without his permission, that he would beat my ass savagely.

A kid with enough balls to actually take the handgun to school obviously wasn't taught that same amount of respect for guns.  Or maybe he wasn't taught the same respect for his step-father."
hidden,"I think he is referring to the notion that an education can only be gained in a classroom setting, teaching subjects like English, Math, Science, etc.

There is discussion about whether or not this sort of education is right for the developing world.  Maybe the more traditional forms of education in their culture have more to offer realistically rather than an education aimed at training people to join the work force in the developed countries.

That said, I don't think it applies to your situation."
hidden,"That's a good question.

Well, we need to ensure that women and men are being judged by the same standards. And two of the things that are important for supporting female faculty on campuses are both financial support for their professional development as well as importance to the campus and the administration. Having female role models are very important, particularly in the STEM fields. Scholarship and outreach to the community are very important. The K-12 Engineering Academies is something we have at Marquette's College of Engineering that promotes engineering and STEM education from a young elementary age for both genders. If I had the power, I would expand the K-12 idea even more to make STEM fields cool for everyone.  "

It's a double-edge sword but the negative effects don't really harm the overall success of the viral infection.

It's important to note that flights rarely follow their exact filed flight paths. They adjust for weather, ATC instructions and more. If you look at a given flight on FlightAware on any given day you will see that it will vary from it's projected path. It's not a rare happening at all.

EDIT: Most pilots for example don't want to fly through a massive thunderstorm if they don't have to. They'll divert around it and that will cause a variation to the filed flight path. "

It was well known that rebels had access to advanced Buk SAM missiles from capturing Ukrainian military base (http://en.itar-tass.com/world/738262).

We should also not discount possibility that plane was shot down by Ukrainian government troops - they have some history with shooting down civilian planes.

Saving time and money is all good unless it comes at the expense of safety.

hidden,"There are different models as to how this kind of stuff works. 
For your concrete example:
So you want to move your amr, right? Generally you do this because you want to achieve something. The brain constantly monitors the environment while keeping a ""list"" of stuff you want to do. So then you are thirsty and your brain plans a course of action to remedy that. You see a glass in front of you, and the planning center in your brain then tells your motor area that it wants to grab this glass. Your motor area then 'calculates' which commands it has to send to your muslces to move the arm in exactly this way and then sends those commands. While your arm is moving, it is constantly being watched over and corrected (you feel your arm, you use that feeling to ascertain if it is moving correctly, if not, you change the movement plan). 

The catalyst here was your obervation that you were thirsty, which led to a plan to drink something."

What's new is how the health food industry is exploiting yet another ""scare"" for profit by labeling certain packages as ""GMO-free.""

There is certainly dangerous stuff being put in our food but it's really more where you would expect it...our fast food, pre-packaged meats, even ""diet/fat-free"" foods.

With all due respect perhaps your personal view is only trough a  window by your own personal experience. Not only that that window is placed in a nation with, for lacking a better term, half-assed gun laws and very limited ways to check up on those gun laws.

Also I want to reiterate again that there are ways to allow law-abiding citizens to be armed in a safe manner while installing measures that reduce the number of guns bad guys can have. This has happened all over the world time and time again and with the proper legislations it can happen to the US too. "

You may argue that this veil allows women to have no voice on choice in society, when in actuality they really do. Except in Saudi Arabia because it is the site of a dominant religion and you have to respect the strong religion law of that land in order to survive. "
hidden,"I, too, had Mono as a child and have had similar experiences to what others have posted in this comment tree dealing with general malaise. 

What has helped me the most is regular and effective exercise - both strength training and cardio, since they help in different ways. Strength training just makes everyday life easier, and cardio improves your energetic output on a daily basis so you can do more.

It's not exactly the right sub for this, but /r/EOOD (exercise out of depression) is a great resource for how to fight that malaise and get yourself going.

Hope this helps anyone else, it's sure helped me over the years.

Also, *stay hydrated*. I was chronically dehydrated for the first 20+ years of my life without realizing it. I feel so much better when I drink plenty of water every day. "

If I was a manager I would set the expectation with the employees that the restaurant closes at that time but they should not always expect to leave at that time."
hidden,"Would it be possible to make your own business out of this? For instance, you could offer the service to farmers for say, $10/acre? I imagine you could image several hundred acres a day easily while having fun with a drone.


If you map 10,000 acres a year at that rate you'd bring in $100,000 for yourself. You could even offer to do a demonstration to farmer who are skeptical. You could do one of their fields, show them the results, show them an estimate of how much your information will save them, and then offer to do the rest of their fields.


It seems potentially extremely lucrative if you are one of the first people to offer this service!"
hidden,"We’re seeing a progressive erosion of humanitarian law and respect for the Geneva conventions. In practice, this means that civilians and civilian spaces are increasingly coming under fire rather than being protected in war. Part of the reason for this is the increase in civil conflict, where wars are being fought within cities and populated areas, which increases the risk. Secondly, even popular uprisings have been marked by the criminalization of medical care, where patients have been arrested for seeking care and doctors for giving it. These two trends taken together pose a serious risk to hospitals and healthcare workers worldwide. While there are potential risks in being outspoken, we try to measure these risks, and there are possibly greater risks to remaining silent.

That's just a stupid statement. You're making assumptions. You're judging everyone, and arbitrarily choosing your culture over theirs.

Because people are being retarded, and trampling on each other, just to feel a little safer, or superior.

What people don't realize is that his ""experiment"" didn't end after 6 months. He didn't quit and go back to a cushy lifestyle because it got too hard. When he moved back to help his family, he returned with only the connections and money he made off of the original $25. He was still moving furniture, driving the same car, using the money he had made. And even with just a ""small wad of cash"" he didn't end up broke. And even if he did, the message of the book remains. Once again, he's not trying to say that bad things won't happen or that being broke is easy.

IE, do the reality bending equivalent of walking around a maze from the entrance to get to the exit. Literally sidestepping reality itself and moving outside of space/time.

There are theories that state that the universe is virtual. Not like computer generated, but it's a projection. The theory goes into some serious quantum physics stuff that I can barely comprehend. But it basically implies there's a plane of existence outside of the known universe and that viewing the universe from that point would be like looking at a piece of paper, that the universe as we know it is three dimensional as long as we are inside it, outside it's two dimensional. It's some really crazy shit.

EDIT: thanks for downvoting and not answering the question. Here's what I found for other people who are curious:

&gt; “Ukraine is a country,” William Taylor, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told Time. “'The Ukraine' is the way the Russians referred to that part of the country during Soviet times. ... Now that it is a country, a nation, and a recognized state, it is just Ukraine. And it is incorrect to refer to the Ukraine, even though a lot of people do it.”

&gt; It may seem like something only linguists care about. But to Ukrainians, it's a big deal, Taylor says.

I remember the old Counter Strike days where when you wanted to connect to a game, you had a titanic list of games in progress where you could browse pings, whose playing, etc. In modern days, Leaderboards and Achievements drive people to compete. But how do you make them fair? If you can connect to ANYONE, why not just have a game with a friend's account and win over and over? You'd get a huge win to loss ratio and laugh at all the people actually playing the game. The current solution is to matchmake with random people who you most likely do not know. That way, your position on the Leaderboard is actually earned. This does however create a problem. Diversity. The more match options you can choose, the more you fracture your player base. Even if you have 5 options, you now can only matchmake with 1/5 of your audience! With such a limited number of players, matching skill levels becomes challenging.  - Scott"

1. With widescale adoption of GMO crops, then corporates essentially develop a monopoly on seed supply if that becomes the industry baseline for purchasers.

2. Cross-pollination from GMO crops to normal crops &amp; non-crop plants, and the effect this has on local biospheres and the animals in that local cycle which rely on that flora for existence."

The U.S. has been a leader in developing much of the technology.  Adopting it country wide has other issues and could be facilitated in our country by increasing government support in the private sector to make it more affordable in our country.

In the meantime, third world countries--especially Asia--as they increasing energy sources and infrastructure should invest in new, not old technologies.

To be blunt, by the time major settlement pushes to the west began, the genocide was all but complete. What the US was doing by that point was cleaning up the survivors of an apocalyptic epidemic, now thought to be the worst wave of diseases in human history in terms of percent of humanity lost (up to 1/3 of human alive in that time period basically. Far worse than the Black Plague). "

hidden,"Since this is a serious question, I'll give my opinion for a serious answer.  I think the word terrorist depends on the intent behind the attack.  If the intent is to ""terrorize"" a group of people (or government) by attacking civilians, then terrorist is the correct term.  But if formal war has been declared and civilians are casualties during an armed conflict, then I don't think terrorist is the right term.  The difference is whether or not a civiliain plane was the target or if it was mistaken for a military plane.  There also has to be some acknowledgment that both sides understand that war has been declared (or is imminent).  I'm thinking of the difference of small groups or movements that ""declare war"" on large governments but have no formal military units and so they are more appropriately classified as terrorists."

hidden,"Canadian here, we're a strange culture. We're surrounded up here by everything American. American resturants, American Walmart (and now target), American Movies, American TV, American Food etc. We're surrounded by it, and it's not to say we don't enjoy all of those things, we do, but we also tend to latch on to anything Canadian made.

Tim Horton's was started by a former canadian hockey player, thats a two-fer, hockey and canadian born together. So in the hearts and minds of millions of canadians Tim Horton's is canadian made and some how the quality of coffee is increased.

We all know deep down the coffee tastes like dirt, and the pastry has gone to shit since they got bought out by American run Wendy's... which means it not even canadian anymore, but most people gloss over it and go with the canadian tradition of standing in line at 5:40am on a winter morning freezing your ass of for a double double before taking your kids to hockey practice. People from Ohio might get it.

hidden,"I doubt you remember me, but [we met in the hall of fame during Atlanta, Ga's Dragon Con in like 2012.](http://instagram.com/p/PICmX5ra_A/?modal=true) You've always been a huge inspiration for me, and gave me some wonderful advice about being an actor. I just wanted to thank you for the love, and for showing me how important it is to be kind in this industry. 

My question is, what is something you did when you were just starting out that was the most important to you in the long run? and what is the biggest lesson you wish you learned earlier in your career? "
hidden,"When I initially signed up over a year ago, I lived within 20 minutes of the fertility clinic. About one month before I was selected, I moved  back home with my grandparents for the next six months as they sort out some health issues, and my grandfather recovers from a very serious medical issue.   

I don't believe you should have any issue finding an agency--there are agencies in my area closer to me now, however the one I applied with happened to only have locations in Fort Lauderdale. 

Best of luck to you both!"
hidden,"Yeah, Thursdays were our crazy days. Since our location was 24H, our owners and mangers insisted that the display cabinet had to be at least half full before we could leave, regardless of how busy it was... Which meant staying sometimes an hour to two after we were supposed to finish. Prep killed everything. Like donuts were bad, on a busy day they delayed evening, but prep, fuck prep. Took at the very least an hour and a half with the amount and process the mangers wanted us to do the prep in, which included using one of the scoops to make cream cheese balls out of the bricks they came in... For every type, which came out to about 6 regular, 4.5 h&amp;b, 2 light and one strawberry. Took freaking forever. Combining that with having to do tomatoes, chicken salad, soups (easiest part though) and the donuts, baking and finishing on time at my location was almost impossible"
hidden,"Yes. 

Nobody here has answered you accurately. Peer review simply means that a panel of subject matter experts have read the article and found it to be plausible. In the process the experts give feedback and usually they request revisions. If they think there's serious problems with the article then they have the right to reject it from publication.

Peer review doesn't mean the article is free of errors. It may means it's plausible. Look at the quality of the journal if  aren't sure, good journals have stricter review.."
hidden,"I work in a grocery store that has a Subway-like sandwich bar and we have the same rule for four items. The way it was explained to me (Warning, may be low-level management BS) is that the particular food items are shipped to us pre-cooked but are FDA rated to only be served hot.

We have programmed settings on the toaster for each individual item, accounting for 12"" subs, 6"" subs, 12"" or 6"" subs with extra meat, 12"" or 6"" portions heated without bread, and 12"" or 6"" extra meat portions heated without bread. 

If the FDA reg is actually true, then I'm sure that each setting was programmed to heat the meat to a certain degree consistently."
hidden,"It sounds like you have many of the symptoms of CFS. I had EBV and i had and still have many of the symptoms that you did after that. I could be totally wrong, but I think maybe the reason you read that EBV doesn't cause CFS is because nobody is really sure what causes CFS, and there isn't a whole lot of research being done into CFS and it's causes at the moment. As far as i know though, it is very common for people that have severe EBV to exhibit symptoms of CFS for many years after they were first sick. In my opinion, they must have at least something to do with each other, otherwise CFS wouldn't be so common in people that have had EVB and Mono. "
hidden,"Holy shit, you used to come to the comedy night at my bar on Sundays on College St. (name withheld).  This would be WAY back in 2003.  You did a bit about you and a black dude stripping from some gay dude and how it ended up in larceny.  Your roid jokes were WAY ahead of their time.  The couple times I worked you killed and I loved having you in.  As opposed to the 90% of guys who went up and totally bombed.  I can't tell you how glad I am to see that you made it and your script got picked up.  You were seriously talented right from the beginning.      "
hidden,"Rhetoric is all well and good, but I think MEDCs proselytising about the dangers of air pollution to LEDCs will have far less of an effect than imposing tariffs on imports from severely offending countries.

I understand that this probably happen anytime soon, given the chummy relationship between government and the corporate world, and an unwillingness to majorly piss off the electorate; just food for thought before we all start taking shots at China and the like - the more developed countries must do something beyond hosting these frequently fruitless climate summits every year or so.

hidden,"&gt;Odessa wasn't a false flag, it was hired thugs who went to far

Maybe, but it became a false flag when they blamed it on the separatists.

&gt;They didn't hide who they were.

The people who dressed up like separatists while provoking the right-wingers alongside and with the aid of the police certainly did.

&gt;BUT..... the sniper attacks in Maidan, which put this government in power, were obviously false flag attacks.

Most likely, yes. Still, it's impossible to know that one for sure.

&gt;You never here the crazy assertions from Kiev being reported on the Western news.

But when you do they report it as fact.

hidden,"see - A Causal Model of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) Risk Louis Anthony (Tony) Cox, Jr.∗ in Pubmed.  In laymans term, when our mucociliary escalator begins to fail, waste of various forms accumulates in the lungs.  This debris causes the lung to age faster than normal, and the two obvious mechanisms are bronchitis and emphysema, but the entire physiology is affected.  ANYTHING that removes secretions will slow, stop or reverse this process.  Insufflators are fine for people that will use them - I like the Lung Flute and specific yoga chants.  But, as I'm sure you know, compliance is poor.  Insufflators do little for lymphatic drainage, but western medicine has limited understanding and respect for the importance of the pulmonary lymphatics.  Using gravity to support this elimination seems like an attractive, low-cost, low-risk approach?

I think Benjamin Franklin said ""if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail""."
hidden,"It's not good. At all. For example, I think that McDonalds has better coffee and better breakfast, and I'm sure many would agree. And that's just sad, being worse than McDicks.

Tim Hortons is just *everywhere,* it's VERY fast (usually), and very cheap. They used to have a reputation for simplicity/quality/value, and now that it's changed the customers just haven't left yet.

So yeah you aren't missing out on much. It's just the place that we go to get our daily caffeine fix for cheap. And American fast food chains are SO MUCH BETTER."
hidden,"What makes you think cows eating grass is a better baseline for humans than corn? Is there any evidence for that? Humans may not be ""meant"" to eat corn either, but I'm not sure that a herbivore on its preferred diet is any better of a baseline for human physiology than a herbivore eating corn. 

Arguably, it might be a better baseline for humans than grass, because at least they are eating a common feed item then. I mean, humans get all kinds of problems from our easy calorie rich diets anyway. It clearly isn't our ""optimal"" either. Why would you compare the optimal diet for cows to a ""feel free to eat garbage"" diet for humans?"
hidden,"Yes, I would. I learned a lot about people and myself in those two weeks. I affirmed even more. And most importantly, without having a great way to quantify it - there's a difficulty to compellingly accounting for the great value of a single drop of water in a bucket - I think I helped more than I would have by not getting involved.

As far as Magic 2015, Ultima V was the first computer game I ever played on my own own computer on my own time. Everything before then had been on school computers, mostly Oregon Trail. My cousin gave me a bootleg copy; I didn't have the maps, rune translations, spell words, or any of the other information from the manual. I had to figure everything but the basic controls out on my own. I loved the sense of discovery. Shawn Main was the point-of-contact with most of the external designers, but the way things worked out I got to help Richard Garriott aka Lord British design his card over the phone. I said thank you of course."
hidden,"As far as Gmail is concerned we don’t have anything to announce at this time.

At the moment we have no plans to change swipe so that it deletes instead of marks a message as done.  We think it’s important to have a non-destructive dismiss action so that you can swipe away both email that you need to save as well as email that you don’t need to save without having to think about it.  But, we’ve heard the feedback that some users want it to be easier to delete and we’re exploring different options.
