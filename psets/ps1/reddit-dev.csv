worldnews,"OK, so I did some digging. Slate sources the FP article on this information about 13 000 feet. FP sources the Mine Action Center of Bosnia. On their website, I could not find any such information. This was expected, since foot is generally not used as a measurement in Europe.

What I did find was this: the total supect area where mines continue to be found. It currently covers around 1.230,70 km2, or 2,4% of total country size. (That's about 4 037 730 feet).

Other things you'll need for first time apartment folks: hand soap, dish soap, sponges, cleaning powders or sprays, toilet brush, plunger, broom, shower curtains (and those rings), shower supplies, a dining set (matching plates and utensils), lots of cups and mugs (either matching or unique, plastic or ceramic) and maybe a shoe rack so there isn't a pile of stuff to step over when coming in the door.

iama,"Subway Sandwich Artist was one of my first jobs as a teenager and I've always loved it.  After I joined the military I went back and did it for six months to make extra cash.  Every now and then I can convince one of the Subway workers to let me behind the counter and show my wife I still got the skills I used to have!  :-)

And yes when I worked at Subway I used to eat WAY TOO DAMN MUCH!  The death of me was the cookie dough.  That and the six inch double meat chicken sandwich with bacon, turkey, and ranch at the end of my shift.  

I put it in the title because it was a job I had that I really liked.

worldnews,"i am no expert. but i was more worried that there may be fabrication of evidence that the jet was already faulty in some way etc. Given how low the rebel forces stooped in the immediate aftermath of the news and started pointing fingers at the Ukrainian airforce, and how they currently have control of the crash site, I am not hopeful.

Also, i believe they already breached international protocol by sending the black box to russian authority. Usually, the country the crash occurs in takes over the investigation, who will then likely request assistance from some outside source. 

At least the NTSB will try to get involved, given that it was an American made jet that was downed.

science,"&gt;This is a good point. However who would want to? How could they compete with newer generation GMO seeds? 

If you're not paying the cost of R&amp;D, you should be able to sell the seeds at a lower price.  (Sort of like how generic pharmaceutical companies make money by selling drugs once they go off label; much lower profit margins, but that doesn't matter since they don't have to pay the R&amp;D costs so they make money anyway.)  Don't think so much about ""roundup ready"" plants; that was one of the main uses of the first generation of GMO's, but in the long run, other modifications are going to prove to be more important.

So just because machines are doing the shitty boring work doesn't mean we have the luxury to work at whatever job we want; There will be more people than available jobs. And if you think they will create new ones then I will ask Is there a need by business owners for those new jobs? Who will create these jobs? If there's now millions of people who can choose their own business wouldn't there be like 1000's of the same kind of businesses out there, making your income very low.

You keep pointing to Vietnam War memoirs as an example, but you know very well that none of them signed multiple NDAs and took numerous oaths, as you did and then later broke. Even guys who did, such as MACV-SOG members sure as fuck didn't write about it while the conflict was still on going and in fact waited decades before doing so.

science,"This actually neatly explains sudden speciation change - if there is a virulent disease, those with the genetic immunity to the disease may have unique difficulties which, as they breed themselves free of THOSE problems (the potential for which is in their genetic variability, of course), create unique exemplars who become separated from the base population as long as the virulence last. The sub-population breeds with the larger population *in volume*, changing the larger population. 

Example: Genghis Khan by himself as an exemplar is an ancestor of some surprisingly high volume of the general population in Asia. This is because his clan reproduced in volume for a period of ascendancy before mixing back with the large portion of the population. "

Wrong. People who can make those kinds of investments want those taxed lower. Oh my those poor rich people are being taxed more than once. You know who pays multiple taxes on everything? Fucking everyone. We pay income tax, and then we have to pay sales tax or property taxes or any other kinds of taxes. This whole being taxed more than once thing is not new or exclusive to rich people. 

Do you think if we had higher capital gains taxes people would just stop investing and throw all their money into a savings account?

They said that EBV has been linked to kidney problems, but that it was a bit unusual. I was wondering if you might be able to elaborate on this association. How does EBV cause renal failure?

Also, I understand that EBV is also in the same family of viruses as chicken pox, which I also had an slightly weird reaction to as a child (chicken pox in my eyes). Does this suggest a particular susceptibility to herpesviridae in general? "

iama,"1. Don't delegate because you read it's the right thing to do. Delegate when there are things you should be doing instead
2. When you decide to delegate, be clear about what you will delegate, how you will communicate, what the expectations are, and how you they will be accountable. Communication is key. 
3. Play to strengths. Understand your strengths and your team members strengths, and delegate accordingly. Sometimes you will retain some responsibility that you would otherwise have delegated if strengths don't line up appropriately.

I remember my son saying he was too sick to go to school frequently.  After about 6 months of trying to handle it the right way my son finally had enough an retaliated.  He got in trouble and was devastated.  I remember him crying in the car on the way home from school because he felt he was just as bad as the bully...felt like a bad person.  It took my wife and I some time to convince him that he didn't do anything wrong.  Interestingly enough, the bullying stopped following his retaliation.  Zero tolerance policy removes common sense from the equation.  My son should never have had to feel like a bad person for defending himself.  I'm so glad to see this point discussed. "

The guest on the radio show remarked about how psychiatry is the only medical profession where a doctor could say something like that. Imagine a doctor saying, ""I don't believe in cancer.""

worldnews,"Unfreezing a chapter quite plainly is an action that contributes to Turkey's accession, it does not subtract from it. It was done by French officials. I don't get what ""official policy"" you are referring to here, a state that has resolved against the accession of Turkey, with finality, need not bother itself with these things you see. There is a simple answer whenever a question arises, and that is NO. Not let's debate over this, and definitely not a yes.

I don't see what points 2 or 3 have to do with our discussion now, but Greece's veto is solely due to the Cyprus dispute, which is resolvable and thus, again, variable in nature. 

You are assessing Turkey's odds of accession based on the current or foreseeable political climate. Which means that you yourself are aware of the variability of political climates. If it was once possible, and it's not now, this does not mean it won't ever be viable again. It's human nature, people can be convinced and persuaded. "

science,"To answer your question less combatively than /u/lookingatyourcock, people have noted that BMI is inversely proportional to the *square* of your height, when adipose tissue should probably be related to your volume, which should be proprotional to your heights' *cube*.

• Among groups in a multi-group population
• And so on...
As soon as you make fitness comparisons in this way, it is controversial that natural selection can be a significant evolutionary force at higher levels of the hierarchy and that group selection is an especially strong force in human cultural evolution. There is no cogent argument against it. The appearance of disagreement is based on other frames of comparison; for example, by averaging the fitness of individuals across groups or the fitness of genes across individuals and groups. The situation is similar to someone who speaks only English complaining the German is confusing and wrong, just because he doesn't speak German.

worldnews,"I'm just explaining the issue in Turkey specifically, and why secularists see increasing headscarf wearing negatively. The idea that Turkey is secular is very important there. 

Headscarf bans are contentious in Turkey, and some have been repealed recently, but they're contentious in non-Muslim European countries that have them also.

The United States is one particularl model but you can't really say ""religious beliefs don't influence politics"" there because they most certainly do. And a lot more than in most European countries. But the state itself is secular and is meant to stay out of religion."
todayilearned,"Why does it need to be the best? All it needs to do is the job it is advertised for - i.e., be high enough pip that you cannot tell the pixels apart from your typical viewing distance. 

Anything beyond that is just bragging for the sake of the specs - it doesn't buy you anything more than you get at that crucial threshold point, unless you are in the habit of holding the device 2 inches from your face. 

I don't care that my device has slightly ""worse"" specs than some overly-feature-stuffed bloat handset, I care that it does the job I bought it for. "
worldnews,"I think that birthright thing should be done away with. When illegal migrants have a baby, it's like a boulder that holds them in place and they can't be deported because the child has to have a caretaker. I think we should remove citizenship from those born to illegal immigrants and give them national status(exceptions for Military and other people who have served this country).  I often hear Mexicans and Mexican-Americans saying Mexico is so great. Well if it's so great, why don't you move back there?"
todayilearned,"I never encountered or heard people talking like that. The Germans are extremly polite. We sure have asshats, like every other country too. But beeing racist is a pretty no go here. Also, Uncultured and lazy is something we don't think Americans are. Especially uncultured, I mean, we have almost no culture besides bratwurst, beer and the whitest dance of the white dances. 

Something that a friend told me is extremly different, is that we are extremly sarcastic. If we don't like you, we will tell you straight in your face, if we like you we will joke a lot. (This is an extrem generalsation about a country with over 80 Million people, but this was told to me is a big difference).

"
iama,"Thank you for saying that. :)

Not really, we did get mortared on the FOB but it would happen and I would just think ""crap that was close"" and go on.. I didn't really allow myself to think further than that. The closest I came to death was when I was on the phone with my mom, a mortar hit (she heard it) and I said ""I have to go"" and hung up. Apparently, she freaked out.. got hysterical. I finally called back to tell her that I was fine. If I was near her, she would have killed me for scaring her! I should have explained a little better what was happening and that I was fine."
askreddit,"Not my neighbor, but my boyfriends.  He was the worst.  To start, this apartment building was full of families.  He always had crazy parties on weekdays after him and his friends would get back from the bar at around 2 AM.  Cops would get called from other people.  One night he left his dog outside on a leash and it was barking for hours wanting to get back in.  Cops showed up again.  There were countless times that his friends would insult us from inside their apartment (while their screen door was open and we were outside).
The worst was when people woke up to screaming, banging on doors and profanities to find that there has been blood smeared all over the walls, the doors, everything.  When the cops came in the morning, they didn't do anything.  They also made a huge fuss for being asked to clean up the blood on the door handles.  Landlord let my boyfriend break his lease early because he knew of all the issues.  There is a ton more, but that was the worst of it all."
iama,"**Yuval**: The most important parts are being a person that's fun to work with and having the right skillset. I've noticed in the games industry it's also important to be passionate about gaming.

Regarding the skillset - it depends on which part of the team you'd want entry into and which product. Lua's very popular for mobile games and I personally enjoyed making a game with MOAI. We have lua on our automation team, and php-mysql for certain parts of our build system. So send us your resume. We don't do these trick questions at Blizzard but I've enjoyed practicing the ones on https://projecteuler.net/ before interviews. But if you're looking for another skillset - definitely C++ and then maybe Python. 
"
science,"Once again, you're conflating a model of farming that you dislike and technology that has generally made that model of farming (marginally) less harmful to the environment. It hasn't reduced the amount of petrochemicals used in aggregate, and I never said it did, just reduced the amount of herbicide by comparison to non-GM crops grown the same way. You dislike the impact of that model of farming but blame the technology that is not responsible for the damage being caused. 

No, I did not fail to distinguish models of agriculture. I suppose it was too much to ask for introspection from a stranger on the internet, but hey, thought is for later I guess?"
iama,"&gt; I don't like archiving every email, it wreaks havoc with searches later on.

Too few people understand this!  I use gmail for my personal email and we have GApps at work so I spend a lot of time in gmail.  It's really so much better to delete unneeded emails, especially when your mailbox grows by 5GB/year.

That said, I've trialed Inbox with my personal account and it just isn't for me.  I've always kept on top of my email, unsubscribing, setting up filters, labeling, archiving etc., that my gmail inboxes for personal and work are really just that: inboxes.  A message rarely spens more than a day or so there and I don't need much help organizing my email otherwise."
science,"&gt; Well I'm a master student so the money didn't come out of my budget,

That just means it came out of your supervisor/promotor's budget. 

&gt; And we were invited by Sensors to contribute to a special issue

You and every other scientist out there ;-) I know those mails, I got one from Sensors every couple months.

&gt; After receiving permission to write it and having the fees paid for by the university I jumped on it, because how often does a master student get a chance like that?

It happened rather regularly with the top students at my university, but you'd indeed really have to be a fool to decline. And you even got first authorship? Well done."
iama,"Another subway employee here. This guy is either lying or works for one of the most perfect stores on earth.  

Here's the truth. Subways are a franchises. So every store has a different owner. In my experience, they see subway as a cash cow and have little interest or knowledge on how restaurants should be run.  

At my store cleanliness is lax (but not as disgusting as it could be--it used to be worse) and we don't even have a manager. The owner comes in once a day and does something at his desk but rarely takes a real interest in what is going on in the store.

The employees get no paid time off, no sick days, no holiday pay (even when you work a holiday) and no christmas or quarterly bonuses. (we don't get so much as a card from the guy on christmas/birthdays).  We are not encouraged do a good job, so we dont.  We do just enough to keep the store from getting closed for violations.

Every store is different. But this is how mine is. "
iama,"It was a flagrant 2. A foul with no attempt to go after the ball. That's pretty much the definition of a dirty play. If he had hit his shooting arm in an attempt to prevent the record, that would be different, but he hit Bev in the neck(or neck area, can't remember). The fact that he didn't want the record to be broken wasn't dirty, the foul used to prevent it was.

Also, the closest we have to full proof is a quote from the Coach of the offending team. I'm not sure what else could be used at that point."

worldnews,"After any tragedy, if information related to the family is posted, you can bet your bottom dollar some disturbed people will torment the family in all sorts of ways. Families of the deceased involved with a controversial/popular event are incredibly vulnerable to these kinds of attacks. Not just pesky reporters want in on the 'action'.

edit: That's not to downplay the affect even reporters can have on a family. It pales in comparison, however, to receiving a letter about how x deserved to y in z. All sorts of sketchy business, surely."
iama,"No, you don't have to move.  Today, with the internet, anyone with talent can be discovered if they create and produce something original and compelling - a web series or a short movie.  With inexpensive high def cameras and editing programs movies can be made and submitted to film festivals.  If you're more of a writer than a film-maker, you can go to a university film school and try to hook up with a young filmmaker to work with.  There are legitimate script submission websites like inktip.com that has had success selling scripts for non-professionals.  Hope this helps."
worldnews,"i suppose you are american- because thats quite the opposite of what europe wants (at least the part that is paying for all that shit). some ~65% of all germans even are against *any* sanctions at all. the fearmongering media is already questioning itself on how they failed in demonizing russia and glorifying the ukrainian regime. 

the french ""front national"" who openly sides with putin (!!) is currently polling strongest in france for the upcoming european elections in may- so are many other nationalist parties. the european left is also heavily critizising the ukraininan coup. 

"
worldnews,"probably because non-Arabic Muslim countries do not have the same clout in the Muslim world as Arabic countries.  Muhammad was an Arab so there is an implicit understanding that Arabs are a higher form of Muslims than the rest of them.

I'm not saying most Arabs think this way but it is what the establishment thinks, which is what matters.  As proof, just do some research on how every single Middle Eastern country treats their labourers, who are predominantly poor Muslims from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh."

But I suppose I made the bad assumption that people reading a comment about correct terminology would actually understand the clear meaning of the sentences, and wouldn't be so utterly dense as to read into it some sort of defence of Soviet crimes. Well done. I can only imagine that you're one of those people who hear someone make the correction that Hitler was Austrian by birth rather than German, and takes from that that the speaker is an apologist for Nazism. 

Or perhaps you're just being deliberately  obtuse, and a dick. "
iama,"There are a TON of things that go on before fights so the mental aspect is incredibly important. The most important is trust. You need to trust in yourself, in your own skills, your conditioning, and your coaches before every fight. If you can get to that point you need to make sure you're still enjoying what you do; to remain a student of the game. If you trust your training and enjoy what you do you have a distinct advantage because that keeps your nerves in check. Of course a lot more goes on but those are some important aspects to me."
iama,"I was convicted of breaking and entering and took a plea to avoid the home invasion modifier. I was also on probation for assault and retail fraud at the time so my sentencing included those as well.

I was pardoned by Jennifer Granholm, the sitting Govenor with a recommendation by the parole and comutations  board. 

I believe it was because I made my plea for a pardon from my hospital bed after being injured in Iraq and maybe s degree of pity and patriotism went into their choice. Idk. All I know is they told me I'd earned my clean slate. I took it."
worldnews,"I don't have to prove anything. It's called reality. It's in front of you and you can't or won't see it, but this is how ridiculous you are, since I don't even know what you think I said that isn't a fact, or why the so-called burden of proof is on me, as if we're in a court of law or this is some sort of intellectual website that relies upon facts, given I wonder what it would take to convince you that Fukushima is a horrific catastrophe that hasn't come to close being fully realized. Seriously, what bug crawled up your ass?"
worldnews,"No it's not justified.

You could just make a law requiring people to remove face covers for police, license photos, any private business if asked etc. In fact I would support that 100%. Business owners should be able to make it a condition of entry that you remove masks, and *of course* cops should be able to make people remove masks. That's just common sense.

But banning face coverings altogether is an invasion of civil liberties and freedom of expression. It also oppresses people from certain cultures but as far as I'm concerned that's not even the main issue here.

It's shameful that supposedly enlightened free countries like France, Italy and Spain are considering this. If people want to live in a place where the government has strict control over clothing then they should just move to somewhere like Saudi Arabia."
science,"How about this:  It's not determinism that ruins free will, it's _predeterminism_.  What really matters is not whether or not an outcome is deterministic in some abstract sense, it's whether or not the outcome can in-practice be forecasted accurately.  

Sure, if you could somehow run a perfectly accurate simulation of a human, you could find out what choice the human would make.  But in a sense, to find out that choice you'd have to allow the person (in the form of their perfect  simulation) to actually _make_ that choice.  If you can skip that step, and make a prediction of the outcome without actually simulating it, then you've got a not-free situation.  "

science,"Not me...after we had a kid, I got less sleep but I also had less time to sit down and focus on a meal. After the first 18 months, I was chasing her around everywhere and taking her places (park, etc) so I was way more active after she learned to walk than I was before we had a child.

But it's tough to believe that people still have time to eat significant meals after they have a kid. How did you do it? I usually ate half a sandwich during the day (working from home) with her in my other arm. Tough to put on weight when you don't have 15 uninterrupted minutes."
iama,"Yes and no..  Clearly he's a child and he doesn't have any physical restrictions.  Hell one day he may even brag about getting away with what he did, because kids are dumb like that. 

I blame the adults in his life, for teaching him that violence is the key to solving problems .. his family has been in the [news] (http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/local-news/code-911/father-of-boy-in-armin-jahr-shooting-sentenced) for criminal activity, the gun owner (his mother's boyfriend) was acquitted of [murder](http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950515&amp;slug=2121170).. To top it off no criminal charges have been filed against the gun owner after he successfully appealed the assault charge in the WA State Supreme Court.   

It pisses me off to no end thinking they really have no consequences for their actions. "
iama,"I did not downvote you.  I just disagree with you.  I'm 30 and have been in IT for almost a decade but I started in low wage positions and I understand the lack of over-commitment when you are making that kind of salary.  It simply is not worth your time at that age when you are making that kind of money to go the extra mile.  I did my job but that was it.  And I got my $6.25 /hr.  Seemed fair. 

You're threatening to fire people struggling to pay bills for being irritated when their plans get fucked up and they make almost no money."

* Participating in all kinds of cool shit

todayilearned,"&gt; Like I have said in other threads about paedophilia, these people have a mental sickness, a medical issue. They, and I know how hard this is, need empathy and medical help from psychiatrists and psychologists. It is the only way to get these people to control themselves and become somewhat functional. Witch hunts do no good. Oh and I am not accusing you of being some sort of raging murderer of murderers, just hijacking your comment to prevent angry mob mentality.  We need to get these people help when they are young, when they FIRST do things like this before they move on to human beings.

Just reposting something I wrote above.
"
worldnews,"Was that what I said, at all? No. I am not saying one is right and one is wrong. I am saying you can't justify comparing the two because they are two different organs and removing a part of one of them doesn't have the same effects as removing a different part of the other organ.

Removing the clitorial hood is not hygienic at all. Please read up on the medical research on that. There is not a shred of evidence supporting it would be more hygienic. Also while removing sensitive tissue on the penis would logically mean a desensitized penis, that is not actually medically proven to happen and it has been tried many times. Men with circumsised penises report equal levels of sexual satisfaction, sensitivity and pleasure from stimulation. The same can not be said for women who have gone through FGM.

It's a very unfair comparison made for rethorical purposes which spreads ignorance about FGM which this article actually is about. Take your propaganda elsewhere."
science,"http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/terminator-seeds.aspx

Maybe there's something insidious in their statement and they're not telling the whole truth about it, but it seems they've never commercialized sterile seeds. Also, concerning the idea that we've been genetically modifiying many organisms since ages, genes modifications with human help but under the usual natural circumstances seems less drastic and hazardous than lab experiments to me. I'm favorable to GMO's but I've heard this argument before and cannot really understand its purpose. Yet I don't know much about the whole lab GMO process."
worldnews,"&gt;people shouldn't be allowed to completly cover up their face in public...it's like ninjas...never know what they're up to (ninjas...not women with burquas).

* Halloween masks
* Other costumes
* Motorcycle helmets
* Welding masks

Of course people should have to remove masks for police identification, license photos etc. Of course private businesses should be able to refuse service/evict anyone who is wearing a mask. No one is arguing against that.

But people should be allowed to wear masks in public places.

If you want to live in a country where the government has strict control over what people wear, then maybe you should move to an Islamic country, no? I hear Saudi Arabia is lovely this time of year /s
"
iama,"I'd like to see more role models. Which means, more women need to enter the industry. I've been thinking about this for some time before launching GMG - how do I get more women to join me in making games? The answer, we discovered, is that you need to start young, to provide them with the tools and skills to turn ""I don't know if I can"" into ""I totally can!""

I joined the games industry a little over a year ago and every time I attended PAX/GDC it made me feel very alone (as opposed to my prior life working in finance/economic research, where I had several female peers, and dozens of prominent role models to look up to). Here's to hoping this changes in the coming years! "
iama,"Version guy did make millions doing this, so that's sort of the trade off.  Jake from the State Farm commercial likely has made 30-50k if it's been running for 3 years.  He's getting around 12k a year for it to run  on cable, more if it shows up on the networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX).  

The money he makes (and Version guy) is exactly there for the cost of overexposure.  In the past, they could just run these spots into the ground and you'd be equated with that character.  Now at least you're being paid to be over saturated in the market (It's also to prevents you from appearing in competing companies spots.)"
todayilearned,"Drugs are a dragnet to catch other criminals, or people who might commit other crimes. Drugs are the perfect rope to give criminals just enough of to hang themselves. They are insanely easy to police and create an opportunity for people to occupy people who might be committing other crimes. If the war on drugs was meant to stop drugs the sentencing would be the other way around, harsh sentencing for use and less for distribution. There will always be distributors, economics dictates that, but there is a fixed number of people who will use drugs. 

The war on drugs is really a war on people who are willing to break the law (criminals) the weapon is they are fighting the war with is drugs. So really this makes perfect sense. "
worldnews,"They probably had old intel on weapons capabilities. Apparently the terrorists just received a missile system capable of reaching commercial airliner altitude a couple days ago.  The airlines probably did a risk vs cost analysis and decided the threat wasn't sufficient to warrant routing around the area. I suppose this could be called negligent; I wonder how often this sort of thing happens without incident? (flying over ""closed airspace""). If they listened to every idiot with a shoulder mounted rocket launcher who ""closed"" their airspace it would probably cost quite a bit in extra fuel. Guess they didn't count on the idiots having the big guns this time.

At any rate, extremely unfortunate. "
iama,"I hope the change of scenery helps her even a little bit.  It seems like it would. Constantly being reminded of a traumatic event definitely doesn't help you heal. I'm sure it's hard enough for her without having to return to the place everyday.

I suffer from anxiety, so I know how debilitating it can be. Plus, insomnia not only makes you feel general awful from lack of sleep, but it's also pretty stressful and frustrating because you want to sleep so badly. Its really tough. She can get through this, though. She's obviously a strong girl. 
Best of luck to her and your family."
askreddit,"Once, and only ONCE, when I was little (3~), I stepped on a baby.

I was at the babysitter's, and she wasn't doing SHIT. The baby was just walking around crying and bawling it's little eyes out. It walked right into my room, while I was watching spongebob, and kept crying and crying. I got so annoyed to the point were I just snapped and stepped on the baby. 

He started crying harder, and instantly I felt so FUCKING BAD (like, I wanted to kill myself BAD) that I picked him up and hugged him and cuddled him for the rest of the day. From then on, every time I think of that (which is relatively often), I feel so bad I just want to punch a wall for doing what I did. Since then, I find myself extra nice and caring to babies because I feel so guilty."
science,"Dr. Shepherd,

I write to you as a radiologist who does some work in molecular-genetic imaging at an academic center on the east coast.  I have a particular affinity for neuro as a field and if you had to pick one area of which you studied that you felt molecular-genetic imaging would be particularly high yield, where would that be?  As a physician, my fluency on cellular and molecular trends in this field is no doubt less than your own.  If you could flip a switch tomorrow and be able to target and thus image genetic markers of one particular disease in patients, which would you choose (and why?)"
iama,"OP was stating this in response to the bitch woman, not the little girl. The little girl didn't press the issue: the employee just stated the policy/system/9th level spell that prevents him from adding points after completed transactions and the little girl walked away. If the mother came in and said ""my daughter didn't get the points, please add them to my card"" then OP would've done so, but the woman came in irate and demanded a manager before he could do anything about it.

That's what I gleaned anyway. "

**Key Points**
 ---
&gt;* Mention a cyborg to a Ukrainian these days and they probably won't think of ""cybernetic organisms"", or man-machines of science fiction.
&gt;* Instead, the word now conjures up images of rugged, heavily armed men holed up inside what remains of Donetsk Airport in war-torn eastern Ukraine.
&gt;* The airport has become a symbol of Ukraine's fight against separatists, and the ""cyborgs"" are Ukrainians who have held on to it despite persistent rebel attack.
&gt;* The nickname was first used online and has since become a media staple in Ukraine.

science,"This is misleading.  You shouldn't compare elite athletes to the average, but to people who eat as well and exercise moderately.  Afaik the current research suggest that elite athletes live ~2 years longer than the average, but *less* than someone who eats as well and exercises only moderately.

For example:

iama,"Dude(tte), every day at 5:00 we have an online editorial meeting (which I have to go to in a minute), and the knowledge they drop is amazing. The food guy will be like ""Frozen yogurt is DONE,"" and I'll be like WHAT? as I slowly lower the frozen yogurt I am eating beneath the table, out of view. Then The Cut people will talk about trends I have never heard of that apparently teenagers have been doing for 50 years? Also, all the politics and news people have way smarter thoughts than I do on all that stuff.

Anyway, all kidding aside, they're amazing folks to work with and being around them makes me smarter. There's no bullying, except for the time they stole my inhaler and locked me in a locker and hid my original Legend of Zelda NES cartridge. But no hard feelings because they invited me to a party way out in the middle of nowhere upstate late on Saturday night -- I'm going to meet them there since they said they already have rides. -JS"
todayilearned,"Actually, I think a better analogy would be putting bacon next to a trained dog. The dog (person) has no idea why he shouldn't eat the bacon (fruit), he just has been told that he should not by the owner (god). 

The thing is though, you could go through this same thing with the entire bible: if God has all this power why doesn't he just stop everything bad? If God is good why does he allow evil? If God wants people to do right why does he give them the free will to do wrong?

Christians have to grapple with these unanswerable questions all the time, but I think even the non-religious have to admit that it would be impossible and relatively conceited to try to figure out the reasoning and motives of a God.

On a personal note, if a God exists I actually appreciate him setting me up in an imperfect world and giving me the freedom of choice. I know that is a controversial philosophical viewpoint though, and slightly off topic."

worldnews,"Right, who is to say that AI wouldn't decide that rather than killing people it would govern them altruistically like a benevolent dictator?

 It's just a movie, where the AI thought that killing all humans was the best course of action.

 I think it if it was truly so far developed, it would realise that the war wasn't beneficial, especially not considering its initial goals of protecting itself. Surely segregating itself, making it impossible for humans to shut it down whilst using it's resources to put humans to better uses, negating the need for war, would be better."

science,"An object with non-zero mass will have infinite kinetic energy at light speed. An object falling into a black hole will reach light speed as it crosses the event horizon. The only way that both these conditions can be met is if it accelerates for an infinite time.

That is, in our outside reference frames that time will be infinite, although not in the falling object's reference. Time will be passing slower and slower for the falling object as it approaches light speed, therefore it will reach the event horizon in a finite time, as measured by the falling object itself.

worldnews,"I was not using GWP as a prosperity indicator, but to show what value all the goods and service produced each year would look like divided up per individual worldwide. The mean/median distortion matters little when redistributing to cause an equal outcome for all.

Poverty is a very subjective definition since each state/organisations have different qualifications of poverty. I was using extreme poverty as a baseline since it is used more universally. It is an income of less $1.25/day (in 2005 prices) and set by the World Bank. For the United States, $23,850 is the poverty line which is $65 a day and every other government uses their own measure. 

Extreme poverty is below 2% in most developed countries. These rates in the West have been slightly increasing since the financial crisis, but the are at far lower rates than the amount of people being lifted out of extreme poverty by developing nations.

He basically said that when planes of this size are hit by smaller rockets or missiles, they break up into larger pieces than if a plane were to just crash into the ground. The fact bodies are still intact could be because the plane might not have completely disintegrated right away and could have glided to a lower altitude before falling apart. There are no videos of the actual event or the plane falling, but all signs suggest the plane was shot down

Lonesome Dove was made correctly the first time. The experience of reading the book was translated to the screen very accurately. To remake Lonesome Dove, you would have to find a group of filmmakers that would be comfortable with glancing at the source material, and then throwing it in the corner and saying,""Imma do what I want"".

In England, people's medical records were sold to an insurance company for peanuts while researchers wanting to make use of anonymised records for public benefit jump through huge numbers of hoops to be able to do so and have to ensure high levels of security on any computer they are stored on. Of course a lot can be done to store records more safely - encryption and so on - but it seems from the leaks that keep happening, that pretty much no system is full proof. However, do you make purchases online? In that case, you're trusting your financial information to encrypted data managment systems.

The redder the state, the lower the pay typically. Trust me, you got lucky if it's a private job set up by the family. Most people can't afford to pay a direct care staff and have to put their family member into the system of government funded companies. There are positives and negatives.

For advertisers, each type of mail now has its own dedicated place in the inbox, where it’s a first-class citizen - less likely to be considered intrusive or cluttering, and not in competition with other types of mail. Bundling promotions together is kind of like a DVR: it allows users to read promotions on their own schedule. That’s good for everyone."

She did this all during a time when she was expected to just bake pies and do what some man told her. Instead, she went far beyond the call of duty.

Most companies let you use the company car for personal business, which is a nice benefit.

The main theory being that the bacteria would actually use them as defense against other microbes producing harmful compounds.  And that these genes can still be found in bacteria growing  in soil.  So even if we stopped using a certain antibiotic for 50 years, almost certainly it would survive somewhere in something, so that once we started using it again, the resistance gene might easily get transferred back into the relevant population.

But a quick example is Hoover has a installed capacity of 2.08 gigawatt, 3 gorges is 22.5 giga watt.

All industrial revolution is dirty, but the positive side is that China is investing a gigantic amount of money into green energy, far far more than any other country.

So it's not a fair to compare advanced economies with emerging economies. Roll back the comparison to 1930s to see where the stats really fall."

This is true, but the amount of fundamentalists who believe the bible is literally true is terrifyingly large. Just look at how big creationism is!

Even then, some non-fundamentalists will also pull the literal card when they see fit. See how people always bring up Leviticus when speaking up against gay rights, while simultaneously ignoring the rest of the rules layed down there because they arbitrarily do not apply anymore.

While I agree religion and spirituality are not fundamentally bad, the fact is that it can easily be used to legitimize terrible things that would otherwise be ridiculous (such as the stoning of this doctor), and that is an absolutely terrible thing that must be stopped in any way possible.

MDR is moderately drug resistant TB, these strains are treatable, but it's a long process. 

The problem with TB is you have to take treatment from 6 to 18 months. It's hard enough to get people to finish a 4 week antibiotic treatment, getting people to finish a 6 month course is proving extremely difficult. This is the main reason why resistant strains are growing

iama,"I'm in Eugene, OR and the bubble continues to inflate. It seems like we get a couple new breweries every two years or so, just in my town. I'm not sure if it's actually a bubble or if we just really like our beer. The home-brew, craft/micro scene is pretty wide spread and accepted as part of our culture. We have an annual brew-fest which always gets a ton of people excited, bars dedicated to craft brews/imports, several growler shops, and the micros outnumber the ""big brands"" on tap at the normal bars. Hell, we even give beer/cider for gifts around here... ah, Utopia...

Basically, in Eugene, if you're not drinking craft beer, you're from out of town or at a frat party. "

iama,"First, I must I say that your written English is fantastic for a non-native anglophone. There were a few minor errors, but don't be discouraged. I would actually be happy to help you make the minor modifications to make this ""perfect"" (my English is flawed and I write in it for a living).

As far as whether or not it should be written differently? I don't think so. I can tell you how many articles I thought were genuinely well written that I submitted somewhere to no avail. The sad fact is your piece migh not have even been read, let alone closely. These things happen. In my experience, you have to make submissions and applications often. It's like anything else in nature; the best model for survival of the species is mass reproduction. I was repeatedly discouraged when my writing was not appreciated or even responded to. But the more you put your work out there (or try too), something takes root eventually. It just rarely feels like it will until it does."
science,"It's possible to get around it for some reasons. One guy I know can't publish anything until a patent is granted because publication means the patent can't be granted.

Another guy who is funded by the same body as me can't publish anything because he's under the Official Secrets Act. His viva/PhD defense board will have to sign it as well to examine him. Wish I'd managed that one.

Also heard tales of a few folk who have been in the stages of writing papers and their thesis and suddenly someone has basically published it out from under them. Depending on how close to finished they were, some of them get to just defend without publication.

But yes, my understanding is, by definition, a PhD must be material noteworthy enough to be published."
iama,"Well, they're more part of the Scottish identity than the Irish, but there is such a thing as an Irish bagpipe (properly called the *uillean pipes*) which is a distinctly different instrument than the Scottish varieties of bagpipes.  Chiefly, the Scottish breeds of bagpipes use lung power to inflate the bag via circular breathing into a pipe, whereas the uillean pipes use elbow power to inflate the bag via a set of bellows which are strapped to and operated by the elbow.  Uillean pipes are very common in traditional Irish music."
iama,"Oh, I see. Torrid is actually women's clothing! In regards to men, though, a lot of our men's clothing comes in way way way bigger sizes. We've got some pretty large shirts and jackets and so on, folding a men's XXXL shirt into the nice neat piles is no easy feat. Maybe you're not looking in the right places for them? I'm sure someone working there would be happy to help you, because larger men's clothes are definitely available.

If there's something more you're thinking of, though, I think you should definitely recommend it to the company! Torrid comes from the company listening to customers, and we even have little lists of suggestions posted in the store that you can add to yourself which get sent to corporate, so they definitely want customer suggestion and input. From what I see, they're pretty good about listening to people about what they want to see from them. Give it a shot?"
iama,"As far as I know, there are no laws against playing unsigned acts.  I know a lot of stations still do a local music bit where they will play songs from local artists or bands.

In the past Radio DJ's had more leeway to do as they liked.  However, radio stations are basically a big popularity contest.  If you are listening to a rock station, they are throwing in songs that most rock fans would like.  If they were to throw in an unsigned unknown artist, then many people may change the station simply because they don't recognize the artist or band.  

It's a balancing act. "

iama,"The ballpark had its issues but there were some areas hit much worse.  The concrete structure around the stadium chipped in many places raining debris on people.  And of course the power went out at the stadium as well so no public address system or lights.  Fortunately it was early enough that we had a few hours before total darkness.  Much of San Francisco was blacked out which made driving pretty difficult.   No street lights, no traffic lights, a lot of people out in the streets. 

I lived 25 miles south which was a totally different story.  Power was on, virtually no damage, pretty much normal.  This was strange since I lived between San Francisco and the epicenter of the quake 50 miles south of SF."
worldnews,"Indeed.  Stalin's relationship with Jews was...complicated, to say the least.  His daughter's next husband was Jewish as well, and Stalin seemed to be fine-ish with it.  Stalin's son also married a Jewish woman, who he was quite fond of.  Stalin was a deeply paranoid man, and whether he especially disliked Jews is open to debate - a very complicated debate. 

&gt; Jews in the party were often verbally adroit, polylingual, and broadly educated—all qualities Stalin lacked. To observe, as his daughter Svetlana has, that 'Stalin did not like Jews,' does not tell us much, since he 'did not like' any group: His hatreds and suspicions knew no limits; even party members from his native Georgia were not exempt. Whether he hated Jews with a special intensity or quality is not clear.

The wikipedia page is actually fairly good on this; although as per usual, lacking in context and specifics.

science,"&gt; GMOs are neither good nor bad, just like chemicals. Some are good and some are bad. We just need some level of regulation around this, since as per usual regulation is falling behind reality.

&gt; We're fast approaching the time when any tinkerer can create quite exotic GMOs in their sheds at home for not a lot of money and when that day comes, do we want people to create some kind of tomato cross nightshade GMO and selling it at their local market without knowing the health effects?


Show me the evidence where GMOs are bad. You are saying this on the comments of a study where they examined the health impacts of GMOs on 100 billion animals."
science,"So you may have done some research on different fuels and read a lot about them. I did too and came to the same conclusion as you did. Then I actually started working in the field and found that the truth of the matter is this stuff is nowhere near viable. There's one major hurdle that algae faces and that's energy density. You have to somehow get the 1/100th of a percent fuel mass out of the growth medium and that requires more energy and money that the fuel you're extracting is worth. Genetic engineering to make microorganisms directly produce fuel is promising, but still years away on anything approaching an industrial scale. "
askreddit,"This is absolutely not true.  Police brutality is and has been on the rise for years.  The kid that got shot on film could have been avoided.  Just because someone is angry and upset does not justify a shooting.  The terrifying thing about the incident you speak of is the ease at which the police began shooting......and kept shooting.  What level of anger, frustration and a sense of disenfranchisement must he have felt to stand in front of a cop and say shoot me?  I don't think any of us can fully understand but in a twisted way he was saying enough!  I remember an image of a Chinese student in front of a tank.  You are right about people not caring enough about the wealth gap.  We take what we are allowed to have from the wealthy.  Keep us ""satisfied"" and we will be quiet again. "
iama,"you ever think about the fact that all the ""hype"" in the ""media"" about banning guns, putting far more lawson the books etc etc is all just hype and media coming from the gun vendors and lobbying groups? aside from retarded ass dianne feinstein, can you point to any laws that have been passed restricting people's gun rights (national level, not state, although for the most part there havent been many restrictions on a state level either)? i bet not. you know why? cause the hysteria about gun rights is manufactured by people that want to sell guns."

iama,"Nothing Really prepares you because they are going to break you. That's a given. You could do weighted lunges and reverse sit ups. But Luke I said, you will break. That's the point. Everyone breaks. In the first week too. Its about mental strength. How strong is your will? You wanna test that? Scratch your nose once. Then stand still in the center of a room, hands by your side. Stare at the wall. Do not itch or scratch or rub any part of your body for 30 minutes. If you can do that, you're close. But you'll never be ready. 

As far as a ruck, go to an army surplus store and buy a ruck. Army issue. Don't bother getting comfortable. If you test at 40 lbs.... Practice with 50. If your pt test is 2 minutes... Practice at 90 seconds. Every time you think you're ready, make it harder.

science,"Well I do think the brain is magical! But NOTHING about how the brain works is Magic! Nor do I think you need to bring in Quantum physics at this point to understand how it works. I'll give you a basic schematic on how we think this works: Experience from the outside world, through our senses, activates the cells (neurons) in the brain through specific receptors on those neurons. These receptors convert experience/information into electrical activity, which is then propagated through CHEMICAL means from cell to cell through neurotransmitters. Both electrical and chemical signals in these cells than turn on gene expression through a very complicated set of protein-protein interactions. So it's certainly complicated but nothing magical! "
iama,"Thank you! When I decided to put my name on my story, I was mostly worried about what my friends locally would think. Like many moms of a child with mental illness, I lived in fear and isolation. But instead, my friends rallied around me and embraced me and my son. And I entered a wonderful new community of friends--advocates who are fighting for their children, just like I fight for mine. And it was a great opportunity to talk about solutions with my own mother, who has been a first grade teacher for 20 plus years and has seen many of these issues in her own classroom. "
iama,"Thanks for you ama. I have two questions. 

1. I was told that when ever possible I should not wear my glasses (while reading a book or on my phone) is there any basis to that?
2. I am looking into getting eye surgery (lasik,Lasek,prk,etc) but a lot of the places felt like they were simply a plastic surgery business and not a doctors office. How do I know which place to get my surgery? Is the procedure good enough that they are all good? If so should I look for the cheapest option, if not what should I look for?"
science,"Please look at the bigger picture.  California had immense forests, huge valleys, arable farmland and mountain wilderness.  Hell, I'm old enough to remember huge glaciers on the mountains (almost gone now).

Take a look at California now - the amount of humans with our buildings, homes, roads, and dammed rivers (etc.) have actually changed the California climate.  The news tonight said that this drought is similar to the one that happened 400 years ago!  

Like I said, if you think oil scarcity was bad, wait until the depletion from water."
todayilearned,"&gt;Even when it's in the 80's outside (I don't risk it when it's 90 or above) they can sit in a car for a few hours and usually aren't even panting when I return. 

Even starting at 70°, the car can get up to 115° after one hour -- 130° if it's in the upper 80s.

&gt;To say that cracked windows has virtually no effect seems fishy to me. What does cracked mean? If it's a quarter of an inch, I'd speculate that it doesn't make much of a difference. But three to four inches makes a huge difference.

The paper behind the chart cracked them 1.5 inches, but cites another study where opening them 8 inches also made minimal difference.

Obviously stuff like the age, health, and hydration of the dog can affect the risk of fatal heat stroke, but you're really playing with fire here."
worldnews,"It's actually why you should watch. Learn to analyze the spin, and you will learn a lot about the real state of politics. 

As a start, look for priming (when the media or someone speaking through the media sets you up to feel a certain way before addressing a topic), framing (how the information is communicated), agenda setting (what stories are shown as important and unimportant) and, of course, bias.

When it comes to bias, you need to look for the garden variety ideological type, but keep a sensitive ear open and you'll discern other forms, too."
todayilearned,"I know my cop friends well enough, and I know how my criminal friends think, too. So take my story for what it's worth - a different perspective if nothing else. 

The police cannot start official open forum discussions on this kind of thing because a) they don't make the laws, they aren't in a position to b) its pointless and someone will just get fired for trying.

worldnews,"It's not reddit, it's people (who of course make up reddit). The old maxim ""all news is local"" applies here. The world is a big place with &gt;7 billion people. Each person  knows (is acquainted with) about 200 people tops. We need to localize things to try and understand it.

Our brains can't process the faceless masses, but we can relate it to people we know. This is why here in Australia, it's being reported as ""27 Australians killed"", because people in Australia know Australians. I can be pretty dispassionate about news, but I won't bullshit, I ran the numbers on whether I knew someone who might be involved. But we're still taking about 27 out of 23,000,000. It's almost literally a 1 in a million chance."

I was so depressed I took an EXTREMELY large amount of diet pills, at school, in an attempt to kill myself in front of my classmates, which is totally fucked up I am aware of that now, but at the time it seemed like the only option. I was taken off of it and put into therapy for a few weeks. When I was 15 almost 16, I was put on prilosec and it worked wonders for me. I never had any crazy moments and I was well adjusted. I was able to control my depression without giving up any part of me. It's about finding what's right for you. Always talk to a doctor before any decisions are made though."

science,"I posted this to another similar comment

Being peer reviewed doesn't make it the undeniable truth. While I don't really think its possible in this case there are ways to manipulate how results look without actually doing any actual data tampering.

For example if I was manufacturing a painkiller. Under high quality double blind, randomly selected (etc etc) testing was shown to be effective with no side effects in 90% of subjects but made the other 10% cripplingly nauseous it clearly would look bad. However if I ran the same test with different groups of people over and over statistically I could eventually get a batch of people that had no side effects. If i were to only publish this one successful test to a 3rd party analysing it the science would look sound.

I'm not a great writer so I'll stop there but if anyone wants to read more about this type of scientific trickery you should read the book Bad Science by Ben Goldacre, It's awesome"
science,"As a source of fuel, it's true that corn is inefficient. However, as a crop, especially when combined with chemical fertilizers, corn is EXTREMELY efficient. As a C-4 plant, it takes in a lot of carbon. It is better that turning sunlight into energy than almost any other plant, it can be grown very close together, it can be eaten fresh as a vegetable or stored as a grain for later use. It can feed animals, or be fermented and turned into a cheap intoxicant.

This is the reason corn is heavily subsidized, because it has a natural advantage over other crops.

2. While I can understand it not being said in open conversation, did any of your students privately confide in you their disillusionment with the NK state, or express a desire to escape?

iama,"This will probably get buried. But first, as a fellow Tony, it was hilarious when kids on the playground called me ""Tony Hawk"" as if I were insulted.

However, thank you for being such a hero for all the skaters out there. I still love playing some THPS 2 when I can. 

Now, I know it's a long shot, but a long time ago, when you were about 9 or 10, you skated up in Detroit. One of those times you actually skated and hung out with my father.

But the way email works universally is that once you've sent it, it's almost the same as sending a letter. You've sent the data, it's done, you have no control over it any more.

What you're suggesting is that the entire email technology gets redone, and a feature like that would be a serious reworking and wouldn't be backwards compatible. Likely, an ""undo send"" feature would just mean that your email gets delayed from being sent for a bit, and during that time period you can cancel sending it."

Genetically modifying plants to suit specific purposes is expensive, and the company that poured the money in to make it happen should have the right to profit off their work if they so choose. Farmers need not use their products if they don't want to pay for them."

science,"To be an organic farmer doesn't mean your farming using the practices of the 19th century...the past 100-150 years of agricultural research into plant diseases, entomology, cultural practices, and alternative nutrient strategies are all used by modern organic farmers. To equate modern organic agriculture with what might have been seen in the 1800's is totally wrong.  Also do you what percentage of crops on the Earth are irrigated...it is less than 20%...the vast majority of agriculture depends on rain.  Organic crop producers are almost always better off during a drought than their neighbors because their management practices are focused on soil organic matter which increase a soils water holding capacity.

I'm sure Putin didn't give the green light on this specific incident, but arming the rebels (if he did that) is still a very guilty position if they're going to go cause international massacres.  It doesn't help Russia's position and it certainly hurts the movement of the Ukrainian rebels as well."

todayilearned,"From my experiences in engineering departments, it becomes obvious fairly quickly that you sink or swim based upon your own proficiency and talent in a given field. It's creates an intellectually competitive environment, not easily susceptible to participatory regulation through bureaucracy.

Also, engineering is not ""popular"" in the US. FWIW I graduated from a state university (over 20,000 matriculated students) in a graduating class of less than 150 representing the entire department. Easily 50% of the class were Indian citizens, and another 15% were citizens of the People's Republic of China."

I'm thinking of something like a highly managed conservation park, where the animals could live in relative freedom, but still have any specific needs (that a ""natural"" niche couldn't meet for them) taken care of via human intervention.

Also, I don't know how much extinct plant DNA we have access to, but it would be fascinating to try to identify ancient relatives of plants that we use today for pharmaceutical production and discovery and see if we can find drug variants from the ancient versions of these plants."

First of all I would like to thank you for being so involved with the student body, and making students feel more involved in the decision making of Marquette’s administration. I am proud to be part of the Marquette student body. 

I am interested to hear your opinion on the residence hall’s policies on overnight visitation. Students are not allowed to have members of the opposite sex in their dorms after a certain time, every night of the week. This policy is very unpopular with students, and having lived in dorms for 2 years, I can tell you that students will do anything and everything to break this rule. To me, this seems like a conflict of interest—we are paying a lot of money to be in these dorms, and are constantly told we need to act as adults, yet these rules do not allow students to live as adults do. What is your opinion on these rules, and how successful do you think students would be in trying to change these rules?

From your lab website, ""This approach can be generalized to most other disorders where there is an established mouse model and known/suspected synaptic defects such as in Alzheimer’s disease, Fragile X, Angelman and Rett syndromes..."". Two questions on this:

1) How are you trying to affect the expression of Arc in these models? Any ideas on how to modulate the expression therapeutically? Small molecules?

2) Trying to manipulate Arc expression/activity in Alzheimer's sounds like a good idea, however, for FXS, AS and RTT, wouldn't a more effective approach be to target the misregulated target itself, namely FMRP, UBE3A and MeCP2?

Thanks for doing this!"

iama,"&gt;reinforcing fear article ... based on a theory

It's actually based on a couple of scientific theories, classical conditioning and operant conditioning.

&gt;There's no proof behind it

Do you understand how classical conditioning works?

Anything the animal likes enough to act as a reinforcer (especially while the animal is scared) is going to make the animal a little less scared of the thing that is scaring it. The more reinforcing you do, the more classical conditioning you're doing. You're making the animal **less** scared, not more."

5: Infinite profit!

6: Use infinity profit to pay people to make you look good as you massacre children and ensure even more funding. Nightmare mode: Attempt to blame it on the Muslims. Insane mode: Tell your biggest contributor to FUCK OFF as you kill even more children and then simply hire more stooges to manage your online image. "

This whole Israel/palestine thing has been going on for so long that it feels very jaded to read story after story regarding this ancient conflict that has no end in sight.  For the record I despise hamas/palestinian authority as much as I despise the JDF/israeli gov't.  

 Both institutions are giant roadblocks/obstacles when it comes to negotiating peace.  

My sympathy and thoughts go to Israeli's and palestinian civilians who just want to live a normal life (kind of hard to do when both sides teach and indoctrinate you from a very young age to hate the other side).

TL;DR, religious differences and early youth indoctrination.  "

science,"First off, it's not hostile. It's asking questions that no one wants to provide the answer to. Inflection is difficult to understand via writing.

First thing: long term studies will not provide anymore data than what you can gather from existing protocols to establish safety standards. Established protocols are proven and work.

Second: long term studies are ineffective and typically result in poor data quality. Seralini touts his study as being the only ""long term"" study done, but it had a horribly flawed methodology. It becomes increasingly difficult to account for underlying causes that contribute to disease. 

I'm all for testing and regulating transgenic products; however, these calls for ""long term studies"" are pointing at a non-issue. Suggest all you want, but these suggestions need to have a scientific grounding."
science,"The list is easy to verify. If anything the list is quite conservative. Begin with cows. Slaughter for particularly healthy cows is typically delayed until 25 years as the farmers breed them, but the record is 48 years. This can be determined immediately from the wikipedia page describing cattle.

The estimate is clearly what fraction of natural lifespan at which the animals are slaughtered expressed as a fraction the average human lifespan. A few quick calculations to sample and thereby validating it indicates that it is correct. They use the average life expectancy of a boy for the human lifespan."
worldnews,"Quite frankly, I don't care what Ukraine is happy about. If they want to handle the rebels themselves, that is just fine until they start murdering innocent NATO citizens.

That being said, Ukraine has indicated previously they want western help, but NATO hasn't wanted to get involved and increase tension with Russia. If true, this could make them much more likely to help a willing Ukraine."
science,"Once agian shows how molecular biology constantly fails.  A cell often times is orders of magnitude more complex than stupid arrow cartoon diagrams that scientists draw to show how signaling pathways are ""supposed"" to work.  I can picture tons of researchers now studying something like EGFR signaling and moving arrows (KRAS is downstream of EGFR).  Hey, after all, knock out EGFR with an inhibitor and you should kill cancer right?   Too bad doing that just makes it resistant a large portion of the time.  

It has been said before that giving cancer patients just a few very specific molecular targeted drugs is now unethical since it will likely lead to resistance.  It's no surprise that you get better efficacy with combinations of drugs (which we do most of the time anyway) and it just illustrates how poorly we really understand single signaling pathways.  Cancer needs to be studied holistically.  "

    ps ax | fgrep ntfs-3g | fgrep -v grep

Also, I don't always see it with other filesystems, but if you hit 'mount', the drive might show up as filesystem type ""fuse"".

And FUSE is pretty cool anyway -- most distros probably don't ship with the rest of that list out of the box, but it shouldn't be too hard to get your hands on something like sshfs. I don't even install nfs anymore these days, I just sshfs into my fileserver."

Every study done shows around a 25% gap. if you include things like career choice, hours worked, education, and experience, there is remaining gap of between 5% and 8%. That's huge.

Not to mention, there is no evidence from economists, only guesses, as to whether or not discrimination affects things like career choice. Not to mention there is clear and concrete evidence of widespread discrimination in things like hiring, performance reviews, promotions, and salary negotiation.

But I'm glad to hear you've read opinion columns paid for by politicians and think tanks that tell you otherwise. You've been bought and paid for by lobbyists."
todayilearned,"Mostly right; the authority figure is the key piece in that experiment, and they had orders to verbally encourage, verbally chastise, and verbally command the participant - in that order. IE ""You should continue, we need the data. You need to continue, it'll ruin the experiment if you stop. You *must* continue, there is no other option."" If they refused after 3/4 commands to continue, they stopped the experiment.

The other major change was if there was another participant (another confederate) who went only so far before stopping and complaining; if we see someone else complain and make a stand, the chances that you'll make a stand shoot up dramatically.

Also, knowing the victim goes a long way.

As a final note; 60% to lethal range isn't that bad, compared to the original tests. A little on the high side, but in keeping with a general trend of disobedience in society since Milgram's original experiment."

If these protests were being staged in Singapore, which is a fully developed economy and has a large middle-class, I'd support them whole-heartedly. 

Given, however, that they are being staged in Hong Kong, and could have a highly negative effect on a huge developing economy which is still susceptible to instability and chaos, I think many of its supporters are myopic and rash. "

I wonder if match.com takes that one into consideration.  It's more about people than men or women, and even then, the time that people put into their work varies day to day, week to week, month to month -- *especially* among developers.  ""Crunch time,"" developers are practically always working, but then there are slower times when somebody who doesn't know better might wonder if a developer ever works.

worldnews,"Yes -- that is why Saudi Arabia is pushing down the price of oil. A cheaper ruble works out well considering that Russia has ran a trade surplus for years now; it just makes their exports cheaper. There is some risk for key imports that are denominated in USD, like rare minerals used in computers and cell phones. However, that is mitigated by selling oil in USD -- which is now much more valuable for Russia. 

But this mitigation strategy is more difficult when oil is less than $80 per barrel. At the moment its a game of chicken.

At any rate Americans routinely underestimate Russias economy. They export a significant amount of industrial technology. They're essentially the only country that can compete with the US in terms of high level technology exports like nuclear reactors, military hardware and satellite systems. And under Putin they have historically ran a trade surplus -- even in 2014 despite sanctions."

iama,"My question is : I understand you gave the camera to people who really were putting their life on the line, but there were many instances I thought you were risking your life just by showing the camera. Do you worry about being caught while filming or are you simply trying to get as much documented, you become blinded to the risks? (outside of the fact that you **are** in a battlezone every day)

note: **Thank you** for a great piece of journalism and putting your life on the line to get the story out there for all to see. It is truly heartbreaking watching little Sara embody a combination of being scared, naive and hopeful all at the same time. I hope for the best outcome for all citizens of Syria.

science,"Well, there is the idea of Wing Assisted Incline Running (WAIR; nice [blog](http://nimravid.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/wing-assisted-incline-running-and-the-evolution-of-flight/) entry with some refs about it), and the fact that extant basal birds tend towards flightlessness (ostrich, emu, etc.). 

It is still an active debate, obviously. I am curious if the authors tried to publish elsewhere and got relegated to J. of Ornithology because their ideas were shunned by reviewers, or if it's genuinely not well done? I have little expertise in this particular field.

iama,"THIS x1000!!!!. I went paintballing with friends for the first time back in July and one of my friends just stayed in the back the ENTIRE TIME. It was a combination of being scared to get hit and some weird thinking that being the last on your team to get is some accomplishment [It's not, if your team loses, then you still lost and were probably a BIG reason why they lost. If your team wins, you didn't get any ""kills"" or ward off any attackers and had 0 to do with the win]. He had to the nerve to say he didn't have much fun and that laser tag is better smh. The times I've been laser tagging, they were pretty awful experiences so of course I disagreed."
science,"I'm really sorry to hear that. If you can bear with me and look on the bright side, it is likely that the strain that you have is not one of the ones that leads to cancer, which is what the vaccine is really attempting to fight. Although it may be  incredibly unpleasant and suck ass, the strain that you have is likely not going to be deadly, and I think that that's something to be thankful for.

from Wikipedia: ""Both vaccines protect against the two HPV types (HPV-16 and HPV-18) that cause 70% of cervical cancers, 80% of anal cancers, 60% of vaginal cancers, and 40% of vulvar cancers.[7] These HPV types also cause most HPV induced oral cancers, and some other rare genital cancers. Gardasil also protects against the two HPV types (HPV-6 and HPV-11) that cause 90% of genital warts."""
todayilearned,"2007 was one of those rare years in cinema like 1994, 1960 and 1939. Just look at the list of films: 

- There Will Be Blood
- No Country For Old Men
- The Assassination of Jesse James
- Zodiac
- Gone Baby Gone
- Eastern Promises
- Into The Wild

Wow. Just wow! Hadn't realized that the list was this impressive before. Also just the fact that all these movies are kind of original(not screenplay-wise, of course). I would kindly disagree with Stardust and Superbad being in the same bracket as the ones above, though. "
science,"That is a very difficult question to answer at the current time. The reason is that evolutionary change occurs when there is selection (such as differential survival or reproduction between individuals) acting on traits (eg. body height), but evolution only occurs when these traits are themselves in part genetically inherited. Most evolutionary changes are very slow and therefore hard to detect, but in any case changes in the genetic make-up of a species in response to selection (food availability, diet) requires, in reality, a number of generations to be detected. In short, time will tell. "
iama,"[Argumentum ad Monsantium](http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/11/08/argumentum-ad-monsantium/)

A lot of the world also believed 9/11 conspiracy theories and a very very long list of other nonsense, so maybe you should try another angle than; ""The test of the world outside of America"". 

Your comment is also hyperbolic in that GMOs are used throughout the world and many existing GMO products and many more coming down the pike are from companies or entities other than Monsanto. Companies and entities based outside the United States. At least three are EU based companies with deeper pockets  than Monsanto, who like Monsanto sell their GMO products all over the world. 

"
science,"Just read the abstract ... well ... methodologically this seems flawed. There are lots of possible GM modifications. Some of them may be safe, others may be harmful. If we assume a fairly wide distribution in terms of the intensity and character of the modifications, how can we consider it a quasi-experimental treatment?
The study is descriptive at best, but it seems to be quite a stretch to determine cause and effect (or the absence thereof).
It's fairly stupid to say ""GMO is safe"" or ""GMO is unsafe"". It's just a method. Of course it can be used in harmful and helpful ways. Each modification needs to be tested independently."
worldnews,"While you are correct, constitutionally, the president is just the figure-head of the country.  He primarily has ceremonial duties and has very little (read almost 0) real power

Pakistan follows a parliamentary system, so the leader of the country is indeed the Prime Minister.

As an aside Bangladesh has also had multiple female prime ministers.

Though in fairness, I don't think this speaks at all to Pakistan's notions of gender equality, rather the brute power, political, economical, and military that the Bhutto family has to ensure that a woman was elected as the Head of State."
science,"I think it is like many psychological disorders. There is a sliding scale. Just like autistic spectrum disorder. Psycopathy can present in different ways as well, some will be impulsive, but some wont be. Some can plan ahead, some won't. The thing that all psychopaths have is a diminished or non existing sense of empathy and remorse. So just like any other disorder it is only bad if it affects your life in a negative way. For all of these psychopaths in well paid managerial positions it is probably a good thing."

I don't see how, unless it is an event where you can have multiple participants from the same country, and they are effectively competing for the same medals. 

Gold just means you were the best on the day. And that is a mark of dedication and focus. The mark of a successful national sporting 'programme' - assuming you believe diversity is better than focus - would be better tied to number of events in which your country is competing, relative to your country size.

worldnews,"I think people assume you are being sarcastic. Assuming you are not, the issue is that the housing units are in the West Bank rather than within the Green Line (aka the 1949 Armistice line/pre-1967 line). There isn't a good comparison to the US that isn't excessively simplistic. This settlement growth (even ""natural growth"" within their municipal boundaries) is strongly opposed by many, who see it as changing the ""facts on the ground"" which in turn may ever so slightly chip away at the possibility of a two state solution (though obviously, others do not agree it is an issue)."

iama,"ALSO the Guinness in a keg we get in the states is BREWED IN ARGENTINA. It isn't proper Guinness. Most of the bottle stuff is brewed in Canada or Central America. If there is a long black spout on the tap it is a nitrogen pour (i.e., nitrogen gas so the bubbles are super tiny and creamy) BUT the beer is subpar as it isn't brewed with that wonderful Dublin water. Buy the four pack cans that clearly say ""Brewed in Dublin"" on them. It's the closest you'll get to a proper Guinness pint.

worldnews,"You aren't free from interference from other people, but you aren't being interfered with by forces that have the ability to force you do do things under threat of violence.

Government is the group with by far the most capacity for coercion. The government should also work to limit coercion in the society (provide help to muslim females if they are being forced to do something by their families). "
science,"Yes and 100 billion is too high, in fact it is unbelievable, what they can only say is they haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary with them, they haven't tested the genetics of 100 billion animals, they just haven't noticed them becoming sickly or ill deformed after pregnancy etc. The lifespan of our animal food however is generally not the longest, especially in comparison to our own, so all it really proves is GM crops will work fine on food animals, they have looked at statistics and seen everything looks about the same which translates to GM foods do not show a notable effect on animals with short lifespans. They haven't tested anything as such and it's almost meaningless to the human population, it's interesting to note but really just statistical. I don't really see anything scientific here.

I don't want to sound like a GM naysayer as I think the potential with them is awesome, especially in developing nations and the 3rd world etc etc etc."
iama,"Major insurance carriers (national companies) I think will be similar to mine. Starting pay is something around $60,000 a year and upper range is right around $100,000. This is all regional - if you are in an area that has a high cost of living the starting pay (like SF or NYC) starting pay would be closer to that upper range.

We are salaried. A private investigator who contracts with the insurance company is obviously hourly and from what I understand they make a lot less.

I have fantastic benefits- great retirement, a month or more of paid time off per year, healthcare, education reimbursement... Obviously there are higher paying jobs but I like the benefits I get and feel that I have a great work-life balance."
science,"To back what you're saying up, I had to do a baseline psychological evaluation a few years ago, it was frightfully easy to tell what was measured. I would often answer ""No more than anyone else I know"" when asked how I felt about things, if I felt I was too angry etc. One question about how often I had ""memorable"" dreams I flubbed because I said I generally don't manage time well so I end up dreaming a bit about whatever I was doing last before going to sleep.

I'm not disagreeing but proof always helps to come to a critical conclusion before judging. Anyone have any screenshots or archive about things the rebels, specifically this account, bragged about prior to this accident? "
worldnews,"That profitability is what attracts major investor dollars. Many people have pointed out in this thread that private research dwarfs public and university spending combined. What we can say about the state of drug research now is that every expensive drug that comes on the market will be available within a few decades for a trivially low cost. We can say that because of the private investment into research, those drugs are becoming available faster than they otherwise would have. We can also say that in the same process, some investors are making a lot of money.

Asked the apartment offices about getting it towed and they said if it has a parking pass, they can't do anything. Found whose car it was and asked her in person to fix it... ""Ain't wakin me up at night, das yo prollum"". Broke into the car in the middle of the night, popped the hood and yanked the battery... she put the battery back and the alarm kept going off. Smeared dog shit all over the car and onto all the door handles... she washed it (like a week later) and the alarm kept going off. Then I keyed a poorly drawn cock and balls onto her drivers side door... and I have not heard that car alarm go off since.

iama,"Sorry, everyone in the fitness sub knows, not the general public.

Go and look at /r/fitness and the progress pics. The natural transformations are amazing and the ones that use steroids are picked out pretty quickly. Plus, they're real people without expensive personal trainers - just average people with average lives but with the motivation you seem to be looking for. That's far more inspiring than a rich celebrity with resources you can't access IMO.

The actors probably could attain those body shapes eventually but they get like 3 months to look like bodybuilders - they have to do what it takes, especially when millions of dollars are on the line. Same with music stars - they get hard meds injected straight into their throats in order to get through huge shows with a cold. There's no business like show business...

science,"&gt;I sympathize, having also lost a grandfather with AD, and a great-aunt is currently suffering.
Paraphrasing previous posts, there's only a small genetic factor to predicting Alzheimer's, and the highest levels of genetic predictability are in early onset AD. In other words not what took my grandfather (and I hope the same is true for you).

You might want to find out if any of your grandparents had FAD: Familial Alzheimers. It has a 50/50 chance of being passed to the child and your parents would likely show symptoms by 30-60 years old.

With late onset and other forms of Alzheimer's the genetic risk factors are not as clear cut.

worldnews,"&gt;If there was a thread on circumcision would you like it if a load of women came in and started shouting about FGM?

If there was a thread on circumcision I would absolutely draw parallels to FGM, because I see both as equal evils, and as part of one discussion regarding the mutilation of infants and children.

We come in here and shout about circumcision because people are *already* shouting about FGM left and right, whereas male genital mutilation (at least in the media) is a sea of crickets and tumbleweed.

How often have you seen news articles like this one, in a paper like The Guardian, about male genital mutilation?

We're jumping at the chance to point out that *all* genital mutilation done to infants is wrong - whether it's to boys or to girls.

Why is it so important that *only* girls' issues be addressed, especially when it's happening to both girls and boys?"

A nontrivial number of boys have had horrible complications from the procedure, including losing their penis (and subsequent attempts to force them into gender reassignment surgery at a very young age, causing huge mental problems later in life).  Why do you want to subject your child to this, for absolutely nothing at all?

There was a lot of place to hide in space, but only a few colonies to raid so crime became hard to stop like the wild west. I called it: Intergalactic Bounty Hunter.

The beauty of something like this is it keeps me from needing to run out and get one of those fatty delicious meals/snacks all the time due to the ease of preparation and consumption.

A Korean airliner was mistaken for a U.S. spy plane by the Soviet air force in the late 1980s and was shot down, and nothing severe came of it.

If war didn't break out over the Crimea, it probably won't happen over this either. To my knowledge, the missile system used to shoot down the airliner was captured from Ukrainian forces, so it will be slightly difficult to pin direct blame on Russia for the incident."

3) I've seen varying statistics on how many cancers are attributable to pathogenic causes, ranging from 2% to as high as 20%. Some studies have gone so far as to say there is hope for the eventual eradication of many cancers through vaccination in the future. Do you think we will eventually be able to identify (and hopefully treat!) a pathogenic cause for most cancers, or do you think it is a small subset (or somewhere in-between)? "

It's a proprietary test that's based on mounds of statistical data from what I understand. The questions are not straightforward. They are not based on the typical symptoms of disease X known to psychiatric professionals.

I'm more concerned about Roundup Ready corn, etc., and how it facilitates spraying of herbicides,and the resulting contamination of those herbicides in the environment.

At the same time, there are studies with mixed results regarding the safety of bt corn to other members of the leptodera family (Monarch Butterflies and Swallowtail butterflies).

Also, Wikipedia is full of sources for most claims, and if there isn't it says so. You need to look at the bottom of each Wiki to find its sources.

This is wasted on you but read the article [Reliability of Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_of_Wikipedia) and check its 222 sources and you might get a better understanding of how it works."

iama,"Because I see a world in which we face an increasing population size serious environmental degradation, water shortages, and increased energy demands. Conservation is great but ultimately insufficient and unrealistic. We need to be able to produce a lot more with a lot less. GMOs can provide a pretty significant aid in that goal. 

It's also a humanitarian problem it's easy to snub GMOs as someone from the developed world where you have options, but the developing world isn't so lucky. There's a drought in California and it's a serious problem causing a lot of issues, but when there is a drought in [East Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_East_Africa_drought#cite_note-Huffington_Post_16_July_2011-9) it affects millions and 10s of thousands die.

But the biggest anti-poverty program in the US is Social Security, and its administration is less than 2% of the cost of the program, far less than any privately managed retirement program.

Moreover, most government pensioners are not eligible for Social Security, that was a deal they took, get this pension, not SSI, so again, their pensions are part of their compensation for their labor, not ""liabilities that hover as a crushing burden to taxpayers."""

todayilearned,"Hey - I meant the yearly review process utilized by most Fortune 500 type corporations, where by each employee is measured against their peer group by their manager, who then rates each employee. What I have found now in over 5 different companies, they all use the same method. They artificially pre-determine the ratio of over -performers, average and below average. Usually only 1 top performer, 2 above average, mostly everyone else average, one under performer. EVEN IF all employees were above average, this system forces manager to pick a designated winner and a designated loser. All it does every year, for the employees that take it to heart, is it destroys their morale. EDIT: furthermore, increasingly, this is just a formality whereby bonus/salary increase are so minute, it hardly matters. but this is worse in US companies.

2) Obviously the indoctrination against the US is great, but did you get the sense being an American there that the next generation/younger generation of North Koreans have that ""revolutionary"" (for lack of a better term) potential in them that could lead the country towards more progressive globalized policies and attitudes in the near future?

I honestly think it's a matter of perception.  If you listen to a station such as Top 40 realistically they have probably at any given time 150 songs in rotation.  

You have the hot tracks that are played more often, i.e once per hour but others are ranked on how often they are played based on how popular they are.  

Even my current gig, is a Hot AC station.  There are a ton of songs in rotation but I sometimes stop and check thinking I just played a song.

Or is it just the case that not all of the content for that game was made with the editor like it was for WarCraft III and StarCraft II? I'm asking because the editor for the original StarCraft was my favorite, so I am wondering if the differences in the newer editors is due to different people making them, or if it is due to the added complexity that they have had to handle by being used to create all the content for the games, or if I am just being blinded by nostalgia...

How did complex symbiotic relationships between insects and plants evolve e.g. the ants who build their homes in protective knots on the branches, but clear the area around the tree of competing plants (I've forgotten the name of the species).

Also, I am considering changing subject areas from chemistry to evolutionary biology after I finish my MSci (since it's what I'm most interested in, and people say you should do what you really want to do...). 

Would you happen to know any universities which have a good masters programme in the subject/would allow entry to such a masters programme considering I will have a degree in chemistry, but no formal biology qualifications above high school level?

It looks like this may be something new - the ""separatists"" have recently ""acquired"" a much larger, heavier [BUK anti air missile system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buk_missile_system), which seems to be what was used in this case, as the airliner was flying at 10km when it was hit.

science,"Well, you're kind of right. the mutation effects the protein MOGS or glucosidase 1. This protein is involved the process of adding sugar chains to many proteins. Some of the proteins that need these sugar chains in order to work properly happen to be surface expressed proteins that some viruses use to attach to cells. So the mutation is not in the cell surface proteins, but in the protein that helps process the addition of sugar chains (glycosylation) to many proteins including cell surface proteins. Surface proteins, like CD4 a receptor for HIV, don't get expressed at the cell surface when they are not glycosylated. Some viruses, like influenza attach directly to the sugar chains themselves, in flu's case sialic acid is the receptor glycan. Viral proteins themselves are often glycosylated and need the host cell to add sugar chains to these protein to make new virus particles. That doesn't happen in these kids' cells.

science,"Do professors peer review for free? I was under the assumption that they were paid - if it's free the cost of submission seems pretty unfair. Not a professor, and it probably depends on the journal. I know a professor at my university who is the head reviewer for the nations journal of botany, which is probably voluntary - but if Nature or Science are requiring work be done by very well qualified teachers free of charge that is ridiculous.

It is not a system that is great for the public who're interested in science, but it is a workable system for those who do science. so my only recommendation is become a scientist or if you're already pursuing that goal, take time to educate members of the public when you can because it is an important aspect of science that many ignore (this is why Bill Nye has been so vocal in America about bad science of late) and there's a growing agreement that it's probably feeding the fire of ignorance rather than starving it as is intended."

I will return to my point of marriage being a forced institution, in that, it was popular and it worked well for an agrarian society. I will also claim that the natural state of higher primates is troops or large family groups with dominant males and that is a fundamental part of the human psyche. We do have higher brain functions that we use to alter our behavior for long term benefit but to do so we must suppress our short term instincts. This suppression will stress us and make us ""unhappy"" if it does not fulfill our long term expectations.

I will close with the point that a long term relationship is one such instance of self suppression (at least for males) for long term benefit. If the long term goal is not satisfactory or does not fulfill expectations it is probably in that parties best interest to end the relationship (contratct)."
iama,"Having two photographs from slightly different angles doesn't equate to 3D vision. 3D vision is the phenomenon in which your brain infers 3-dimensional qualities of the world from various 2-dimensional images. Your argument is really just semantics.

You could use the same argument to say that we all have echolocation, because blind people can do it and we obtain all the information that blind people do plus more. Just because we obtain the information doesn't mean we have the ability.

On a side note, you don't need two eyes to have 3D vision. You can get the same effect when looking at a static scene by moving your head around so that the same eye sees the scene from multiple positions. Your brain can infer the 3D qualities of the world by comparing the images obtained from different angles, the same way it does when you use two eyes."

For example, if you are already in contact with another player jockeying for position in front of the goal, and you extend your arms (with the stick in your hands, of course) to get some separation from the other guy, that will be let go.  On the other hand, if you really *hit* the other player with the shaft of your stick (jabbing at the kidneys, as OP said), you'll get called.

That's nice, but it's not 1759 anymore.  A modern state requires the capacity to draft, debate and enact more complex laws - not amateur lawmakers.

If the State of Texas isn't going to pay its legislators, and actually restricts how long they can sit each session (to 140 days), that suggests to me that the legislature isn't taken very seriously, its capacity to legislate is very weak and overall the people aren't actually getting much in the way of representation.  Of course, laws are still drafted and passed, but chances are that's simply due to the legislature's un-elected legal staff and other civil servants picking up the slack."

You never here the crazy assertions from Kiev being reported on the Western news. I think everyone would be rather shocked to actually hear from the people we are backing, instead of the usual ""Putin bad, mmmkay."" narrative."
iama,"Most people don't believe me. I'm fairly soft spoken, or just downright quiet when I meet new people. When I tell them I'm a voice actor they usually say ""Woooaoaahah-really?!"" They then proceed to request a sample. Keeping a few characters in my pocket is something I almost have to do. I usually just do an impersonation.

Improving is just a matter of practice. Usually, I copy things I hear in the way I hear it. Like a radio commercial, ""I wonder if I can do that."" Another thing I do is read every day junk in different ways/voices. I also take the ""characters"" from the commercial (yes they are characters too) and change the way they deliver the lines. 

The best way to improve is to realize you're not just reading a paper. You have to become that person. Internalize the character. Go ahead, make up a character, imagine what he would sound like, then read the back of a cereal box.

And most importantly, NEVER GIVE UP.

iama,"I managed some cereal today, and now my stomach hurts, presumably due to the beating it just took. The dehydration sucked balls, because I was afraid to take more than tiny sips in case I threw up again. Mostly, I'm just completely wiped out. I don't want to sleep, but I feel too weak to sit up for any length of time.

Worst part is, I live alone, and none of my friends live near me. My family are in another country. There is nobody to come take care of me, or even check that I'm not passed out on the bathroom floor. The first 24 hours, my mother called me every few hours to check I wasn't dead. Oh, and this all happened the day after I got back to my flat after being out of the country for 3 weeks. Good thing I can't really eat much, because I haven't got anything"
iama,"Oh yeah I experienced this, In the US, got shouted at by crazy waiter for not leaving a tip (not me personally but the group). We tip (extra) if service is really good, beyond what is expected, guy done basic job nothing amazing we just left him the change....I don’t agree with the system in US customers have to pay twice imho. 

Biggest advice I can give you coming to Ireland, stay away from Dublin if possible, like most countries (in my experience) capital cities are never the best place to visit. Go to the far west Galway, Donegal, Kerry. Beautiful places Donegal is awesomely pretty mind blowing at times, Galway is great city + close to beautiful Connemara. Kerry + Cork are great spots too.

iama,"Probably more of a regional thing, I'd guess. I'm a Toronto boy (don't hate me, I don't think we're the center of the universe and love the rest of Canada) and here we have a heavy Irish/Scottish/English population. Where-as some parts of the prairies are much more dominantly eastern european.

If you look at Canadian history we had racist immigration policies that selected people from the british isles first, eastern europeans second, and lastly southern europeans. (We had this weird idea that ukrainians made good farmers but italians were all merchants and would be shit in Canada. Immigration law/policy historically in Canada is fascinatingly bizarre). "
worldnews,"The police made an enormous mistake by ""waiting out"" the suspect rather than storming in there and shooting him if he failed to drop his weapon or failed to stop mutilating the corpse of his murder victim.  By allowing him to live, he was turned over to an extremely soft criminal ""justice"" system which is now trying to set him loose so he can behead MORE innocent victims.

Fortunately, many people in Manitoba have made it known that if Vince Li shows up in their areas, he will have a brief and unpleasant stay.  There is still some ""fighting spirit"" left in the province's native population."
iama,"I understand this sequence of statements all too well. Back in high school I used to have a meal right after school no matter what because my school was fuckin ridiculous and you can't snack in class. So I often had to contemplate eating vs sex because my girlfriends mom would be home approximately an hour after us. Her mom worked for the school and was also a lunch lady. She naturally brought home a bunch of good cafeteria food and had that in their freezer. So my girlfriend got smart and started heating up bagel bites and bosco sticks (mozzarella filled breadsticks) directly following sex. Oh the days. Those times are long over, and sometimes I feel with all the great progress I've made in life, I still peaked way too fucking soon.

Longest written piece on my phone. Never again."

I had a cornea transplant (DALK) in my left eye in Oct 2012 and another one done in my right eye (full thickness) Feb 2014! in my left eye I can finally wear a contact without issues. I'm finally able to legally start my driving lessons which is huge for me :) (23 currently, been wanting to drive since 16 but never had the vision for it)

My question is twofold.  First, what is research showing as to the genetic link with nerological disease, and any way of predicting it so it can be planned for, etc?

Second, do most people with neurological problems have several, such as my family, or is it more common for someone to have ""one"" problem only?"

I'm willing to bet 99% of these comments are coming from guys who never even served in the first place. 

Whatever they did wrong, it's between them, the Military, and the Government. It has nothing to even do with you, so stop pretending like you're all offended and so effected by Mark's choice to write his book and Rob's choice to go public.

iama,"Hi. We covered your book in a policy course a year ago, and I found it very interesting (and infuriating). Since it was a year ago, I may be asking something there already is an answer to. How can we ensure livable wages in this climate where ""free enterprise"" is essentially holy? Since, for all practical purposes most of the working poor will remain so (so much for freedom), it's a matter of justice; one that nobody seems to want to rectify *because* of how revered ""freedom"" is. Follow up question, what would be long term effects of tying the minimum wage to a cost of living standard?"
iama,"Tony, I went to see you at the ""Boom Boom Huck Jam"" (yeah, that was the actual name I think) several years ago at Universal Studios in Orlando. I waited in line after the show with THOUSANDS of others, and after hours when I finally got to the front, you were nice enough to sign all of my skateboards I'd brought, as well as having a conversation and taking a picture, and just being a great guy in general. No question for you, but you were my idol and really blew my expectations of you out of the water that day. I don't have a question for you, but you're a great person, keep on keepin on man. Thanks!

Right next to that story was another story announcing that not only was my state (Nebraska) one of the worst for child abuse, but our county ranked third in the state for child abuse. 

We would rather have the police running around busting people for victimless crimes like using a little pot instead of tackling serious live changing crimes.

science,"It makes no sense that psychopaths - apparently intelligent, motivated, sophisticated individuals - would have an array of (apparently) manipulative skills, yet completely show their hand when asked to take a simple test or survey.

My hunch is that the garden-variety psychopaths - those of only modest (as in modestly above average) intelligence and/or those with major grandiosity issues - are very transparent, but an intelligent psychopath would be impossible to detect.

That's the whole point, right, of being a psychopath? That your manipulation is subtle, only used as required, and not flaunted?"
todayilearned,"I agree with you.

I think it's an artefact of the way redditors think and vote that such bots get such huge amounts of karma. This bot, the one with XKCD comics, the one which summarises articles, they're all fairly dumb and add boring noise to the discussion. I mean seriously - they're taking information that is literally already contained in the thread via a link, and then creating a new post with that pre-existing information in it!

Before autowikibot I observed a trend of people explaining things that were brought up and summarised by other people. Basically that information could be found by simply going to the wikipedia page, or by googling, yet people upvoted the material nonetheless."

Also, there's usually a huge tangle of bureaucracy going on that they don't want to bother you with the details about, on a level that Westerners can't even imagine. Often simple things appear to simply get dropped, but in reality, there are other departments involved, just lots of things that get in the way of each other, making many tasks impossible (unless you make it worth everyone's while). In short, there's no efficiency."

Hi
Interesting to hear that you're taking part in a trial of CMV vaccination. There are a couple of different vaccine candidates that are being trialled. They are trying to boost particular components of immunity against CMV. 

Many people have had mono. This means that you now carry EBV in your B cells for the rest of your life (as I, and 95% of people do)

Our vaccine is designed to treat patients who have EBV-positive cancer. So if you ever had the misfortune of developing such a disease (let's hope not) then to the best  of my knowledge you could still be treated by our vaccine (assuming its a fully licensed treatment by that hypothetical moment in time) because many people who have had EBV also carry CMV as well!"
worldnews,"&gt; I am actually sort of shocked by the sudden turn this sub has taken in theast few months. When did we get so Islamaphobic?

Well, Reddit has gone mainstream now, so you're getting a lot of average responses, and answers. It's really shitty that they make laws against you because of your religion. Isn't this what we don't want? How come the government can push people around like this? People are saying that they'll conceal weapons. Fuck. You can conceal weapons in numerous amounts of ways. This isn't going to be much different.

todayilearned,"I moved from CA to WA and it feels like I've gone back in time.  My company just within the last 2 years put recycling bins in the breakroom.  A place with ~180 employees and up until that point they were all throwing cans and bottles in the garbage without hesitation.  I tried collecting cans and taking them to a recycling center, but it really isn't worth it.  What would have been ~80 dollars in CA was only $15 in WA.  My home recycling service is fairly restrictive too, for example they don't take glass because it isn't worth enough to them.


Just seemed really odd for a state that is super green for them to not care about recycling."

todayilearned,"The 40 year license life is not what determines the life of a nuclear plant. The 40 years was selected for financial reasons. 

In terms of actual life of components, there is regular maintenance or rebuilds on almost all parts of the plant. The limitation on life comes down to concrete, piping, and (the biggest limitation) the reactor vessel belt line. The vessels themselves are, for the most part, degrading much more slowly that we calculated back in the 60s with slide rules and no practical data. This is why nuclear plants can get relicensed. "
iama,"I started writing my first one for my daughter while my wife was still pregnant with her. I think she was about three months along when I first started writing it. My original intent wasn't to write a book but just to write a little poem for her. After a few people read it and suggested I should look at getting it published I did a bit of research and ended up going with amazon createspace.

Unfortunately I do not do my own illustrations even though I really wish I could. My stick figures look like a disfigured wood pile. The first book was illustrated by my old elementary school and all the money from the book will go back to the school as soon as I can find a good system for getting it there. Might have to give it to the PTA or an organization like that which supports the school. My second one (which isn't finished yet) is being illustrated by a friend with all the money going to cancer research at her request."
science,"That's very interesting. I too believe that we all have out roles and I don't see a problem with being a sociopath as long as you aren't ruining people's lives. I see human nature as something simple and primitive. Through that mindset, you can sift through the complications that people try to achieve through pride and self absorption, pinpoint the real problem and execute the proper solution without getting mucked with emotion. I warn people ahead of time that they may not like my solutions (for some damn reason people open up to me and I have no interest in their personal problems). 
Anyway, again I believe we all have our roles. I've been told I should be ""put down"" like a dog for what I've done as a child to adulthood despite being the person I am today. I'm glad I have a clear head (for the most part) but I'm also feeling very alienated.  The alienation is driving me to suicidal thoughts. Not out of depression but I just feel ""done"" with this world."
askreddit,"I've had clean roommates and I've lived with slobs. For the slobs of Reddit, I've always wondered do you notice and just not care or do you simply not notice it? Are you embarrassed? Does your pride not allow you to admit fault?

For instance, I had taken out every single bag of trash and recycling in my apartment for the entire year lease(among many other chores). What did she think happened to the trash? Why couldn't she do it after I had talked to her and asked her politely to just take it out when it's full? 

Whenever I attempted communication with past roommates about my frustrations with having to clean up their mess, they would lie and say they clean up all the time or try to shift the blame and bring up something completely unrelated that I was doing wrong.

This is always been something I don't understand and I've felt I haven't gotten an honest answer from these roommates.

Help me understand and be a better roommate."

It was a wild 3 hours of passing on curves in the mountains, driving around farm tractors in oncoming traffic, and passing scores of vehicle crashes by roadsides. Racism wasn't a problem.

Is this indicative of disease progression with the final phase being cancer? How do you identify those at risk for the big C and what can I do to be vigilant?  I feel like the virus has treated me differently than the majority of the population so I want to know if I'm at risk to be one of the unlucky few.

Basically they had one of those childcare pyramid schemes where you keep pumping out kids and basically trust each kid to look after the younger ones. In any case a very young son went out into the garage and basically started a gasoline fire while unattended. He was burned all over most of his body and I can't remember if he died.

It's hard to imagine any responsible practitioners using it at all for diagnosis these days. The homosexual diagnoses was completely removed with the MMPI-2 release. In the original, like the MacAndrew results,  it was also never reliable. So adding the other indicators doesn't matter, it's no more reliable than asking a single question about Alice. The original MMPI was totally quack science. The MMPI-2 has a few uses, but a big problem is it has been widely used for things it shouldn't be and used to make invalid and scientifically unsupported conclusions, such as fitness for particular jobs, or whether someone is likely to steal."

todayilearned,"The figure you cited is for a family of four.  For a single individual the poverty threshold $11,490.  48% of earners make less than 25k per year.  When people hear middle class they think about a certain standard of living - owning two cars and a house in the suburbs with a white picket fence - but that's not what middle class means.  Middle class is the class of people centered around the median wage, and as the purchase power of median wage fluctuates so does the standard of living of the middle class."
todayilearned,"Agree.   To be fair though, it's equally impossible to prove that any increase in cancer rates is NOT due to atmospheric nuclear testing.  

From the baby tooth survey, we know that Strontium 90, which does not occur naturally, had become ubiquitous in baby teeth and levels were steadily rising through the 1950s.  This led to JFK signing the ban on above ground testing.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Tooth_Survey

We know that Sr-90 and others can cause assorted health maladies up to and including cancer.  It seems reasonable to postulate that Sr-90 and others from nuclear testing are causing some health effects.  How much is up for debate.  My personal feeling is that whatever problem existed is decreasing since the above ground testing stopped.  I also feel the initial effects were above negligible but below any widespread worry."
iama,"I've heard of their being problems with mixing beer and liquor, which is itself a myth - it's just a factor of how much alcohol you drink and how quickly, but never with mixing two different styles of beer. 

And the only fight-related thing I've heard in regard to lager in that part of the world (actually next door in the UK) is that ""lager louts"" are seen as more violent simply because the alcohol percentage was usually higher in the typical canned Euro lagers (e.g. Stella at 5%) than in the home grown standard pub ales (e.g. John Smith's at 3.6-3.8%). Thus it was a factor of being drunker due to more booze from the same number of drinks than with standard ales, and more pugnacious simply because of the higher amount of alcohol irrespective of source. Plus culture.

Mixing beers doesn't have anything to do with pugnacity. If that's the rationale bartenders were using, they were operating off of urban legend, which isn't your fault. I just hadn't heard that one before."
science,"Let's look at the example of a rose and its thorns, hypothetically.

At some point, roses (or whatever roses evolved from) did not have thorns, but they have them now, right?  

These thorns didn't simply *pop* into existence, they developed slowly.  In reality, there is a trait that they have called heterophylly, in which different leaves of the plant can have different shapes.  Some leaves were like normal leaves, but some were a little more rigid than others.  Over time, these proto-roses were selected for greater rigidity in *some* of their leaves because it dissuaded animals from eating them more than those that did *not* have rigid, pointy leaves.  Over enough time, these ""pointed leaves"" became the thorns on the rose that we know today.

Does this make more sense?"

With MH370 they have shown time and time again incompetence, so the same airline with the same plane model having another crash is too coincidental too.

There are too many coincidences for both being shot down and crashed. On one side we have jets being shot down in the area, for another we have the same airline and same plane model crashing, when the airline shown incompetent with a recent crash.

I'm just waiting for confirmation of either show down or ""natural"" crash by a non biased source. Until then, I will keep all possibilities open.    "

worldnews,"I just counted 23 women wearing Niqab here on Cowbridge Road in Cardiff, Wales who I walked past on the way to the Post Office and back just now. Your shot in the dark regarding numbers of women wearing ""burqas"" might be right, however, the number wearing extreme forms of Muslim dress more generally in Europe has got to be far higher.

Regardless of the potential for these issues to be exploited by demagogues, this town -- *my neighborhood* -- now has a bunch of people living in it who very much want me to know that they are not and never will be my friend, or trust me or come over for dinner or marry my kid. These are real sociological measures of social cohesion. To imagine they are imaginary is bullshit."
iama,"It's weird, for some episodes he brings in a specialty chef or restaurateur to help train. Other's he just gives some basic cooking advice. It seems a bit unfair.

An example that comes to mind is the episode in NYC on the Indian Restaurant called Dillon's (Renamed Purnima.) The location of this place is absolutely remarkable and yet he still wasn't making any money. Then they go into the kitchen and walk in fridge. It is absolutely disgusting with infestations and rotting food. As a cook, it literally made me gag. Gordon makes the crew clean everything and brings in this specialty Indian Chef he knows and the place becomes renowned while the new chef is there, and then goes back to shit as soon as he leaves. Restaurant closes a couple years later. "
worldnews,"Yeah I'm not saying I particularly like the American pharmaceuticals but the fact is no other country does it as well. 

So while I dont really care for them, I do acknowledge that most of the advances in the medical field come from them. Anothet telling point to the motivation of profit is the fact that the Nobel prize in Medicine is most often awarded to Americans (Or people researching in American facilities).

iama,"I'm a mechanical engineer.  I mostly do the theoretical/calculation side of the design, so I stay behind a computer screen I can sit close to and zoom in on anything important.  It certainly makes it harder for me to go out back into the shop and check out whether the roughnecks are actually building what I design.  But I have coworkers who can see fine, and they let me know if something's up.

The most impacted thing is really my driving.  I have a 30-mile commute to/from work, and when you can't tell the difference between an 18-wheeler and a billboard at 150 yards, highway speeds get interesting."
iama,"Alright I've got one.
What is it you ""do"" per se, to help employ your clients.

I saw in the previous thread that started this AMA a comment about whether they can pay a handicapped person $1 less for the same job and how that would be a business incentive for them.

I'm glad you said you certainly don't let that fly and your clients deserve equal compensation, but that begs the question of what incentives you DO offer employers for hiring your clients.

When I think of your job in a nutshell I think of combating social misconceptions that would otherwise prevent good people from honest work.  I'm sure you give your best 'sell' to employers about how they will not regret the decision to hire your clients, but certainly you have to encounter close minded individuals who don't particularly care about your agenda, so my question is how do you overcome such obstacles, or do you just tell them to get bent?"
askreddit,"No, because people are being murdered for their sexuality. Beaten up. Kicked out of their homes.

It's not meant to make you feel comfortable, or to appeal to you. It's for all those kids out there that don't feel normal, that want to die, that feel like freaks or live in fear of death or injury. It's for all those out there too afraid to be themselves. It's not for you. "
iama,High threat protection sounds fun and interesting too. Do they have safety people in your line of work? if so you would probably be a shoe in with the experience you have. Basically the tough part is getting the experience to have the credibility in your industry. since you have that already then all you really need is an understanding of the safety protocols in your line of work. start taking an occupational health and safety course through correspondence at a decent school that offers it while you are still working. after that it should be pretty easy to find a contract for you in the high threat protection industry
iama,"If you really can't see the huge difference between US and North Korean prisons, you must either be an idiot or heavily biased. In the US, there are certain standards of living that must be met. While they could be improved, they're far better than the concentration camps in North Korea. All the people in US prisons were but there by a trial that went through the judicial process, and they were convicted according to a law put in place by our democratically elected leaders, which could be changed through the political process. In North Korea, they are put in prison at the whims of a dictatorial government, often for saying the wrong thing or even not being patriotic enough. People are forced to dig their own graves, then are killed by being hit with a hammer to the head. Children are executed and tortured. There is not even a semblance of due process.

Also, that $9 trillion missing hasn't been verified by any reputable source. It's only being floated around on 9/11 truther websites.

science,"You didn't phrase your question in a way that asked for someone to take the time to explain it. A healthy diet is not intuitive in this age of cheap, processed box food, stripped of nutrients and labeled in deceiving ways. Fresh fruits and vegetables are more expensive. And they take more time to cook. In most working class households with children, for instance, both parents hold jobs. Thus cooking time is greatly reduced. It is not impossible to have a nutrient rich, healthy diet with little money. It is just much, much harder. Thus we see our poor in the country suffering from greater risk of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, etc. "

iama,"I think this answer covers both questions, firstly Americans aren't fat; the areas I lived and the places I visited everyone was on some super fit drive, everyone was always jogging, everyone looked good.  The weirdest thing I saw which shocked me was that one day I was sat down near a jogging path,  then suddenly someone comes sprinting past with a baby buggie.  I was so worried for a baby,  I was curious about how dangerous it was and all the obvious questions then no less than five minutes later about 4 more of them came jogging past- it was just weird to see. 

Other than that the other obvious culture shock was being able to use a card without a pin, that is so different compared to here in the UK. "

iama,"Sorry.  I feel a little guilty because of all the delicious food here.  

And I thought it might balance out because the quality of other restaurant types would be worse here than there, but I just haven't found that to be true.  I had the best sushi I've ever had in Tulsa the other day.

iama,"Love what you do, just have a correction.

Grand mal seizures (now called tonic-clonic seizures) are a kind of generalized seizure where the person loses consciousness, collapses and convulses violently. The entire brain is affected, the whole body as well, there is a post-ictal period, etc.

What you're describing is a focal/partial seizure or possibly an absence seizure (absence seizures used to be called petit mal seizures). They do not affect the entire brain, so the person can often continue what they're doing. They lack most of the obvious features of a tonic-clonic seizure.

A partial seizure can spread and turn into a generalized seizure, so maybe your client has both kinds.

science,"The issue is that most people are not mathematicians and so there is not just a risk but an inevitability of misunderstanding when people talk about this aspect of mathematical beauty.

Euler's identity is aesthetically ""beautiful"" in its simplicity, but its true beauty comes from understanding the connection between entities which before seemed completely unrelated. It is the idea and the understanding which are important. One does not need to understand anything about a beautiful photograph to appreciate it aesthetically, although some photographs may have deeper meanings. In contrast, if you don't understand Euler's identity there is nothing to distinguish it from any other short, true formula.

As mathematics gets more abstract, the distinction becomes more pronounced. There is little aesthetic beauty in the Reflection Theorem, or in Łoś' theorem, yet they possess true mathematical beauty *if* you understand them."

worldnews,"You are a fucking idiot.  
This thread was specifically about an article that was about FGM. Female. Genital. Mutilation. And yet people came here and hijacked it to be about circumcision.

And notice how I never said I agree with circumcision. I don't. But having a trained doctor perform circumcision is not the same thing as having an untrained person cut the labia off with a piece of glass. Sorry, it's not the same.    
You're a fucking idiot."

Kiev officials call it an anti-terroristic operation, Russian anchormen continue blabbering on about patriotism and how Russia should help their fellow people in a foreign country.

iama,"The LGBT individuals I know are use to having to define themselves for you, such as preferred gender pronoun, and sexual preference if you ask about it. It's best not to assume their gender, it would better to ask ""what's your preferred gender pronoun?"" because it instantly makes them respect you more, even if that's all you know what to ask within the community. They will recognize that you are trying, and will be more attentive to your questions, and might offer more information without you even having to ask it."
iama,"Sadly Amina and her friends in the neighborhood drifted apart, mostly due to going to different schools and having different social schedules.

worldnews,"What was most interesting for me in this poll was Tunisia, having been there for a while pre-revolution. Realize that until the revolution, a woman couldn't go to university or have a government job unless she was dressed as #6.  Now, the bulk of the population says #4, when even #5 was pushing it a few years ago.  #1 and #2 I think are still associated with extremists from Algeria, at least when I was there last, which explains the very low percentage.  I'll add that all the attitudes towards head coverings I got in Tunisia were from women, who were often quite emotional/vocal about their discomfort being forced to wear #6 in order to go to school.  Even 5.5 (not pictured - more of a kerchief over the hair) was frowned on. With the revolution, freedom has brought the freedom to live their beliefs rather than having to conform to a foreign-born form of secularism, and the high percentage that say ""yes"" reflects a desire to let women choose more conservative dress (imho)."
iama,"1) Well, you need to focus on making the student experience second to none. And that includes utilizing more technology for delivering content in the classroom, having dormitory, recreational and other facilities that fit the current needs of the student body, and developing cutting-edge academic programs that train students with the skills they need to be successful in the future.  For example, by providing help for faculty and staff to allow more course content to be online, that allows students to access it when they are ready to learn.

2) Well, one of the jobs I have is making alumni and donors feel like the University is worthy of their investment. So when I go out and speak to potential donors, I talk about all the great things and great people we have on our campus. 

3) The faculty and staff truly care about the well-being of the students. That's the number one thing I hear from students. And there are many options available for study. 

Best of luck to your dad!"
iama,"So it's sort of an honor system until the band comes out. After all that you've done so far I don't think it'll be too difficult to figure something out to prevent abuse. 

Perhaps a link to site accounts could be a helpful way to ensure that somebody actually uses a site. Most of the major sites probably have account age data similar to the way Reddit does (even if it's not entirely public) and you could put in coding to only allow use on accounts older than, say, a month and monitor if that account gets logged into or not."

My uncle came to the hospital while I was visiting and brought me what is one of my most treasured momentos. An autographed picture of you with ""Dear [my name]"" on it.

worldnews,"They're both unfair to the child, yes. But one poses the risk of serious illness and removes almost all ways of sexual pleasure and the other removes a bit of skin.

The other procedure removes the ear drum and other olfactory tissue and the sews the ear shut. Both at bad. But one is far worse in my opinion.

science,"As your article points out, the short-term study suggests that diet soda consumption can ease the transition to a caloric restriction and help with caloric restriction compliance (which is a known major obstacle for those who want to lose weight). If you think that I or the study were claiming that diet sodas resulted in better long-term health outcomes, you misunderstood me and/or the study.

Also, nothing that you just said suggests that there was anything wrong with the procedures used in the study. What about that article ""clearly shows that the study is not consistent with accepted testing procedures?"""
science,"I think that the problem today is that the diagnosis of illness or defects before birth are considered as to dangerous. For science to even consider it as treatment it is necessary to diagnose a patient in the womb without fearing that the mother ""deletes"" the problem if the offspring is not what she wished for. Designed babies are a problem we have to face as scientists if we try to change a human while unborn. in my opinion it will be necessary in the future to do so but we need to be very careful. There will be a time where we are able to do more than we should. I think science already has hit such a point in some fields but the borders are not well set."

Stolen things can only be sold at significantly lowered prices, (unless the item is rare, which would put it in the same pricing circumstances as drugs) and people sell those because that low price is all profit.

science,"What also bothers me about this is that it's being generalized. One GM food does not equal another.

They have made an effort to specifically target doctors and hospitals. http://to.pbs.org/1eODGDc

Think about this for a bit. An attack on one NATO country is an attack on all of them. What do you think this system is built upon? It's just promises between countries and the faith these will be upheld. If NATO does not uphold it's most important promise then all faith in NATO will dissappear in minutes.

Meaning no-more point to NATO and no more NATO. Why would any NATO member keep believing in the promises of the pact if they are abandoned that easily. Meaning a humongous power vacuum in the world and complete destabilization of the current system. 

So there is no ""less important"" country in NATO. Because an attack on any of them without retribution would lead to the complete failure of NATO as an entity.

No one is going to watch all of my content *manually*... they need to be notified of it somehow. That'd be like using Facebook without the news feed.

science,"Interesting thought, but I think with a broad enough lens you CAN think of age as causing marriage.

Picture a 17 year-old couple who are engaged to be married. If you think of that system as having all of the 'ingredients' for a marriage to occur (the consent of two romantically involved people uncomplicated by familial or religious obstacles, etc.) *except* for the legal age of marriage, then you could think of age as being the final precipitating ingredient that ""causes"" the marriage, could you not? Marriage IS contingent upon age.

In short, isn't it fair to say that all contributing factors that lead to an event can be described as having a causal relationship to it?

By contrast, things that are merely correlated don't work this way. E.g., just because people who live in China tend to be shorter than people who live in France, this doesn't mean that moving to China will make me shorter. Being short is not contingent upon where I live, or vice versa."

The research you linked to invalidated their statement of 'rates well above chance' in the quote I gave.  Their study was not of actual field polygraphs, and in actual field polygraphs the results were markedly different.

It should really be quite obvious that polygraphs are invalid due to the fact that were they valid the data would be analyzed by a computer rather than by a human being.  This article discusses a bit of the history of polygraphs and the fact that the same polygraph results can be used to support both a conclusion of deception and truth:  http://www.sciencemag.org/content/290/5493/939.full

iama,"As far as emergency response is concerned, I don't think this requires a large scale participatory effort. What ordinary folks can do is  become active citizens in debate on global health. Most people only wake up to major issues when there's a crisis. Those issues are daily realities for populations in poor countries in Africa and Asia, and if there were more consistent and considered concern from the general populations of richer countries, funds that originate from our taxes might be better used. Also, we can all contribute to keeping the current crisis in proportion - keep images of the Walking Dead at bay and encourage others to do the  same. "
iama,"&gt;at least once or twice a year I'm showing some younger person something fairly simple that I can't believe didn't occur to them. Really simple things, like just dumping variable contents out at various places in your code to narrow down where a mistake is, doesn't occur to folks who will often give up immediately and post their code to some forum asking for help (and receive it within minutes).

Those people just sound dumb more than anything. By a similar token, young people today don't have to know how to spell thanks to spellcheck, but millions of people still manage it. Some do end up not being able to spell very well, but they wouldn't have been able to spell well no matter what year they grew up in."
science,"Copy pasta from a post I posted above: 

&gt; No, that does not happen. Mind providing some reputable source to groundtruth your ridiculous sounding claims? The fact is that the Organic Seed Growers and Trade Association lost their cast against Monsanto because there was absolutely zero precedence. In other words, there was not a single lawsuit Monsanto initiated which was caused by accidental pollination, therefore OSGTA could not legally and preemptively sue Monsanto for potentially suing them in the future.

science,"Autism Question Dr. Shepherd - My children and I have a deletion of TLE-6 at 19p13.3. I've found research by Dr Helena Kilpinen that suggests their may be a link between this gene and autism. From what I can tell TLE-6 is involved in early brain development. We all have the same deletion, however we are all very different, my 5 year old is what you might call mid-functioning, my 8 year old - aspergian, 40 YO me - mild aspergers.
My questions are;
1 - How close are we to understanding how these deletions/cnv's affect our brains?
2 - Can you speculate to when there might be viable medicinal therapies to address social deficits, repetitive behaviors, language deficits, etc?"
askreddit,"Vin Diesel (born Mark Sinclair[1] or Mark Vincent;[2] July 18, 1967)

Diesel was born in New York City. His mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair) Vincent, is an astrologer.[3][4] Diesel has stated that he is ""of ambiguous ethnicity"".[5] His mother's background includes Scottish, English, and German.[6] He has never met his biological father, and has stated that ""all I know from my mother is that I have connections to many different cultures"".[7] Diesel has self-identified as ""definitely a person of colour"".

His step-father was an African-American, Irving H. Vincent (hence the Vin).

So, not from New Zealand, but still a nerd. (He played D&amp;D when he was bouncing clubs.)"
science,"Imposing a tax that unequally targets low-income people is not the solution to a public health crisis, even if it will work in theory. You cannot just apply economics and make everything work, you have to take into account that you are messing with real peoples' lives and income. Proper regulation (labeling especially) and a public health campaign that focuses on the dangers of sugary drinks would likely be more effective, as it would reduce the demand for sugary drinks, and would also limit other sources of sugar in the diet."
iama,"Your biggest danger is going to be crop dusters. Assuming you're keeping it under 400' agl crop dusters will be about the only aircraft you would have a chance of sharing airspace with.

Your ag eagle in the wrong spot could cause over a million dollars in damage and loss of life. Just be very careful with ag planes/copters in the area. I know you said it's going to act in a predictable manner, but if a pilot can't see it it doesn't matter how predictable it is.

Also remember if you're not operating in line of sight then you're in violation of FAA guidelines and your hobbyist argument won't hold a lot of weight.

I'm in both businesses (crop dusting and UAV usage) so it's something I try to keep on top of. I think there is room for everyone, but UAV users will need to be responsible and realize the dangers."
worldnews,"Saudi is really a scourge on the Earth, especially to Muslims. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that the monarchy is just using Islam as a power structure over their populous. The wealthy elite there constantly fly around the world on private jets, buy massive flats in western cities, drive supercars at ridiculously high speed through foreign countries, drink and throw money around at clubs, and philander (often with prostitutes). How it isn't clear what they really are to more people is a mystery to me. They aren't exactly keeping it secret, just check any car forum that they often brag on."
iama,"Yo Chandler! Lifelong **Gators** fan here, and I was at UF the same time you were. I have a couple questions about your college experience:

1. How did coach Donovan help you develop while you were at UF?
2. Do you keep in touch with Nick Calathes? How about any other UF teammates?
3. What was your favorite experience while you were at UF?
4. (*feel free to skip this one*) What is the compliance culture like at UF? Do you think improper benefits for athletes (not just at UF, but anywhere) are common, or rare?

It's been great watching you succeed in the NBA, you've definitely given me a reason to root for the Rockets! Keep it up!"
worldnews,"In other words, living in a [filter bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) and [confirmation bias.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) It's similar to how racist propaganda fueled antisemitism and the Holocaust in Germany prior to WWII. While this story is beyond appalling (and the perps should face justice like European sex-trafficking gangs), what is equally repulsive is using it as a propaganda device for your racism on this sub, just like we see videos and TILs about 'black' crime in America.

iama,Your foundation helped build the skatepark in Old Fourth Ward in Atlanta. I just wanted to say thanks. I started skating again at age 36 because of that park being so close to my house. Ive been at it for 2 years now and it has changed my life. I was severely depressed and overweight skating is helping me fight both. I grew up seeing you guys in the mags and every once in a while someone would have a VHS of public domain or Animal chin and we'd all watch. Many great memories from those days. Thanks Man.
worldnews,"While the comment was terse and a bit sharp, it does highlight a rather pertinent irony in some of the prevailing notions of this thread.

In particular, many opinions have been expressed which seem fairly ethnocentric, ex: ""Good. Having them allowed is another obstacle to having those populations adjust to western society."" So, /u/blue2 recognized a harsh tone incongruent with the ideas of freedom and commented as such.

It is probably best to not strongly denigrate any comment too fervently, as this hinders free discussion and the integral good will of the people in this forum. Words like ""idiot"" wander closely to ""personal attacks,"" and certainly are not good penmanship."
worldnews,"&gt; I don't understand the circle jerk making fun of CNN for giving it as much air time as it did.

Because they spent an idiotic amount of time essentially saying: ""*The latest news on the missing plane is that it is still missing, and we still don't know what happened to it, but here are some celebrities spouting nonsense about it and we'll ask these expert if they still stick to their 'we are still looking for evidence' spiel.*"" combined with ""**Breaking news:** *We still don't know anything!*"" interrupting actual news."
iama,"Hi there,
firstly I would like to say that your business sounds like a great idea and I hope that it will go a long way!

Three Questions:

1. Could you describe how your process of finding someone their ""dream job"" works, as in : how do people find you and how do you find them a job then?

2. Have  you had any negative feedback you could tell us about?

3. What is the range of qualifications of clients you work with (as you have said in another thread that the jobs range from entry level to quite handsomely paid)?"
iama,"Great write up. My feeling was always that Vader owed Boba Fett a debt. ""No disintigrations!"" Because when Vader went to work on the entire Jedi establishment way back, he needed help, and Fett cut a few off for him and managed to even *surprise* Vader with his ability to vaporize every Jedi he came across. Vader is a 'lawful evil' type and knew that one day Fett would be back to cash in. Fett saved his silver bullet until the big payday came along - Solo. So Vader puts up with his crap. ""We'll compensate you, dude. Chill out."""
science,"Sounds about right.  Single men are far more likely to:

* Go out to clubs and dance all night looking for women
* Make an effort to stay fit and slim in order to better attract a partner
* *Not* have kids or partners monopolising their limited free time, and hence
* Have more spare time to devote to discretionary activities like sports or going to the gym
* Eat when and how they want (including skipping meals or eating lightly if they just aren't hungry) rather than at regular intervals that conform to several other people's schedules
* Eat food they've cooked themselves in the portion-sizes they prefer, as opposed to more often having their food prepared by other people and in portion sizes they can't necessarily control
* Generally get more sleep (lack of which is implicated in obesity) without as many calls on their time"
askreddit,"I started out just as a door guy in the service industry. I've been a home brewer for years as well as an avid beer fanatic. I swapped jobs to head the security program for the beer bar when it opened and assisted the previous beer program manager. When he moved on to being a sales rep for a brewery in the state I took over his position.

It is a lot more computer work than one would expect and most of my day is spent in an office. 

But I do get to sample beers everyday and when the festival season is in full swing weekends are spent at all over the state.

My neighbors love me because I get more beer samples than I can drink resulting in them getting the over flow."
