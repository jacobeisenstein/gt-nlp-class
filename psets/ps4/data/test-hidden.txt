Trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared with ###.# million Friday .
But the session was orderly , in contrast to the market 's four-day closure after the #### crash .
Richard Chenevix-Trench , a director at Hong Kong-based Baring International Fund Managers Ltd. , said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close .
In Australia , Sydney 's All Ordinaries index closed at ####.# , down #.# % , its biggest drop since October #### .
London 's Financial Times-Stock Exchange ###-share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of ####.# , down ##.# , or #.# % .
At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off more than ### points .
The Financial Times ##-share index closed ##.# points lower at ####.# .
Volume more than doubled to ###.# million shares from ###.# million Friday .
Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading .
The decline in the German Stock Index of ###.## points , or ##.# % , to ####.## was the Frankfurt market 's steepest fall ever .
Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale , pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as ## % .
To make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of #### equaling ### .
The percentage change is since year-end .
We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's vitality , but maybe the state 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place .
Interestingly , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one .
Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed .
The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards .
Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market .
In other words , California is presuming to take control of the nation 's farm policy .
Consider the greenhouse-effect provision .
Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem .
But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?
The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp .
The initiative seems to have been crafted to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who donate money .
And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits .
This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback .
-LRB-- The Republican candidate , Sen. Pete Wilson , is playing the initiative fundraising game too , sponsoring his own crime initiative . -RRB--
While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through .
This is the state that recently passed the Prop. ## anti-toxic initiative .
If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly .
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like .
That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .
Of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves .
Then exhilaration .
Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday 's ###.##-point plunge , gaining ##.## to ####.## .
While the advance cheered investors who feared a ####-style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders .
The Nasdaq OTC index closed down #.## to ###.## .
Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which each fell more than ## % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon .
Overall , `` this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective , '' said Arthur Cashin Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board .
It 's just a strange feeling .
I do n't think anyone left the place whistling Dixie . ''
But to traders , it looked like disaster on the #:## a.m. opening bell .
At #:## , Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late -- opened down # #/# to ### .
The Dow dropped to a quick ##-point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble .
Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses .
There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets .
This was a hangover from Friday , when Standard & Poor 's ###-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks .
They did n't .
The Dow accelerated its slide , losing ##.## in the first ## minutes of trading .
Then at ##:## the Dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the early-morning fall .
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily .
Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders ' eyes .
According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday ; it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day .
But then it shot upward # #/# as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought , traders said .
Around Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday 's gridlock .
We put some orders together .
There was n't a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally ... .
Not like Friday where they just took -LCB-- the market -RCB-- apart . ''
Grinned Griffith Peck , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department : `` I tell you , this market acts healthy . ''
Around him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water to cool them off .
Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares .
But not everybody was making money .
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P ### stock-index options was halted Friday .
`` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said one Chicago-based options trader .
Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose ## stocks mimic the Dow industrials , did n't lead yesterday 's big rally .
Then when the market was at a technical level to buy , they came in with a vengeance . ''
However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday .
`` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , '' said Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc .
Specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge .
According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues -- AMR , Merck and Valero Energy .
Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index .
No sector of the market has been spared during the past two days ' gyrations .
For example , Halliburton jumped # #/# to ## , Schlumberger rose # #/# to ## #/# and Baker Hughes rose # #/# to ## .
Because of the UAL and AMR tumbles , airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday .
Philip Morris was the Big Board 's most active issue , rising # #/# to ## #/# on nearly eight million shares .
Merrill Lynch added # #/# to ## , PaineWebber rose #/# to ## #/# and Bear Stearns rose #/# to ## #/# .
Federal National Mortgage Association , a recently hot stock , climbed # to ### on nearly #.# million shares .
Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months .
Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday .
`` It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. ## .
They used their judgment .
Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market orderly .
Maybe they learned from experience . ''
Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading suspensions .

The sudden `` flight to quality '' that triggered Friday 's explosive bond-market rally was reversed yesterday in a `` flight from quality '' rout .
`` It was a pretty wild day .
Our markets were closely tied to the stock market , '' said Joel Kazis , manager of trading at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co .
`` Friday 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its legs , '' he said .
That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality Treasury bonds , which are safer than other types of securities .
Contributing to the selling pressure were dispatches by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios .
The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy .
In fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week .
The Treasury 's benchmark ##-year bond , ended about # #/# points lower , or down about $ ##.## for each $ #,### face amount .
After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as #.## percentage point on Friday , they gave back three-fourths of that amount yesterday .
The bond-equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills , for example , was quoted late yesterday at #.## % , compared with #.## % Friday .
Investment-grade corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell .
But prices of junk bonds , which were battered Friday in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session .
Junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed .
Some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying .
The benchmark ##-year bond , for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick ###-point drop in the Tokyo stock market .
But as Japanese stocks rebounded , Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher .
Many U.S. trading operations , wanting to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin , were fully staffed during the Tokyo trading session .
`` Most of the action was during the night session , '' said Michael Moore , trading manager at Continental Bank .

If you guessed black-and-white snapshots , you 're right .
After years of fading into the background , two-tone photography is coming back .
Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black-and-white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans , shoes and liquor .
Portrait studios accustomed to shooting only in color report a rush to black-and-white portrait orders .
What 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography .
On Seventh Avenue , designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done entirely in black and white .
And classic black-and-white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes , spurred , in part , by the backlash against colorization of old films .
`` The pendulum is swinging back to black and white , '' says Richard DeMoulin , the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co. 's professional photography division .
Until two years ago , sales of black-and-white film had been declining steadily since the ####s .
Aimed at commercial photographers , the film can be used in very low light without sacrificing quality , says Donald Franz of Photofinishing Newsletter .
Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper that 's geared to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak 's papers .
The biggest beneficiary of the black-and-white revival is likely to be International Paper Co. 's Ilford division , known in the industry for its premium products .
Sales of Ilford 's four varieties of black-and-white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market , although the company wo n't say by exactly how much .
`` We hope the trend lasts , '' says Laurie DiCara , Ilford 's marketing communications director .
`` It has an archival , almost nostalgic quality to it , '' says Owen B. Butler , the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology .
`` You can shift out of reality with black and white , '' he adds .
Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising .
Consider Gap Inc. , whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of Hollywood stars , artists and other well-known personalities modeling the retailer 's jeans and T-shirts .
Richard Crisman , the account manager for the campaign , says Gap did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors .
`` We wanted to highlight the individual , not the environment , '' he says , `` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . ''
The campaign won a Cleo award as this year 's best ad by a specialty retailer .
Even food products and automobiles , which have long depended on color , are making the switch .
Other companies that are currently using two-tone ads include American Express Co. and Epson America Inc .
Portrait studios have also latched onto the trend .
His On-Broadway Photography studio in Portland , Ore. , doubled its business last year and , he says , is booked solid for the next five .
One customer , Dayna Brunsdon , says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because `` it 's more dramatic .
I show it to my friends , and they all say ` wow . '
It is n't ordinary like color . ''
Still , most consumers are n't plunking black-and-white film into their cameras to take family snapshots .
Typically , it must be mailed to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned .
But for photofinishers , developing costs for black-and-white film are higher .
Some companies are starting to tackle that problem .
Ilford , for example , recently introduced a black-and-white film that can be processed quickly by color labs .
Intent on wooing customers , the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black-and-white photography classes .
Similarly , Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges , offering free black-and-white film and paper as prizes .
And Kodak is distributing an instructional video to processors on how to develop its monochrome film more efficiently .
Other companies are introducing related products .
Charles Beseler Co. , a leading maker of photographic enlargers , introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted at teen-agers who want to process their own black-and-white photographs .
But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad .
They cite the emergence of still electronic photography , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints .
`` Black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color , '' says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute .
`` The color print today is far superior to prints of ## years ago .
`` It 's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally , '' says Alfred DeBat of Professional Photographers of America .
`` That 's the appeal .

The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- ## months before recessions and only three months before recoveries .
`` It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now , '' Mr. Moore says .

BSN S.A. , a leading French food group , said it agreed to acquire Birkel G.m.b . H. , a West German pasta maker .

BSN will initially acquire a ## % interest in Birkel , a closely held concern .

An American journalist now is standing trial in Namibia .
The most likely winner will be the Marxist-dominated SWAPO rebels .
The U.S. journalist 's `` crime '' was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election 's fairness , Bryan O'Linn , was openly sympathetic to SWAPO .
Shortly after that , Mr. O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested and his passport confiscated .
SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the `` sole , authentic representative '' of Namibia 's people in
The elections are set for Nov. # .
In July , Mr. Stanley , editor of American Press International , a Washington D.C.-based conservative wire service , visited Namibia to report on the U.N.-monitored election campaign .
After Mr. Stanley 's article was published in two Namibian newspapers , Mr. O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors , publisher and lawyer .
