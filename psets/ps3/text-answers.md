As you can see from the cells here, the Japanese tagger suffered more of a decrease in accuracy when moving to the test data. Why might that be?

Explain why you think suffix features are so helpful in Japanese. You may want to look at the raw data, and consult some resources that you can find from Google. (No prior Japanese knowledge is assumed!)
Because the suffix in Japanese can easily indicate the tagging, for example in the dev set, almost every word end with "ru" is Verb and most words end with "yi" or "na" are adjectives. Then the suffix would be really helpful for classifying words!
