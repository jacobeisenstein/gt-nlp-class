The
Battle
of
Kosovo
,
also
known
as
the
Battle
of
Kosovo
Field
or
the
Battle
of
Blackbird
's
Field
,
took
place
on
St.
Vitus
'
Day
,
June
15
,
1389
,
between
the
army
led
by
Serbian
Prince
Lazar
Hrebeljanović
,
and
the
invading
army
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
under
the
leadership
of
Sultan
Murad
I
.

The
army
under
Prince
Lazar
consisted
of
his
own
troops
,
a
contingent
led
by
Serbian
nobleman
Vuk
Branković
,
and
a
contingent
sent
from
Bosnia
by
King
Tvrtko
I
,
commanded
by
Vlatko
Vuković
.

Prince
Lazar
was
the
ruler
of
Moravian
Serbia
,
and
the
most
powerful
among
the
Serbian
regional
lords
of
the
time
,
while
Vuk
Branković
ruled
a
part
of
Kosovo
and
other
areas
,
recognizing
Lazar
as
his
overlord
.

The
Battle
of
Kosovo
took
place
in
the
Kosovo
Field
,
about
5
kilometers
northwest
of
modern-day
Pristina
.

Reliable
historical
accounts
of
the
battle
are
scarce
;
however
,
a
critical
comparison
with
historically
contemporaneous
battles
-LRB-
such
as
Angora
or
Nikopolis
-RRB-
enables
reliable
reconstruction
.

The
bulk
of
both
armies
was
wiped
out
in
the
battle
;
both
Lazar
and
Murad
lost
their
lives
in
it
.

Although
Ottomans
managed
to
annihilate
the
Serbian
army
,
they
also
suffered
high
casualties
which
delayed
their
progress
.

Serbs
were
left
with
too
few
men
to
effectively
defend
their
lands
,
while
the
Turks
had
many
more
troops
in
the
east
.

Consequently
,
the
Serbian
principalities
that
were
not
already
Ottoman
vassals
,
one
after
the
other
became
so
in
the
following
years
.

The
Battle
of
Kosovo
is
particularly
important
to
Serbian
history
,
tradition
,
and
national
identity
.

Emperor
Stefan
Uroš
IV
Dušan
the
Mighty
-LRB-
r.
1331-1355
-RRB-
was
succeeded
by
his
son
Stefan
Uroš
V
-LRB-
r.
1355-1371
-RRB-
whose
reign
was
characterized
by
decline
of
central
power
and
rise
of
numerous
virtually
independent
principalities
;
this
period
is
known
as
the
fall
of
the
Serbian
Empire
.

Uroš
the
Weak
was
not
able
to
sustain
the
great
empire
created
by
his
father
nor
to
repulse
the
foreign
threats
and
failed
to
limit
the
independence
of
the
nobles
.

Uroš
V
died
childless
on
4
December
1371
,
after
much
of
the
Serbian
nobility
had
been
destroyed
by
the
Turks
in
the
Battle
of
Maritsa
earlier
that
year
.

Prince
Lazar
,
ruler
of
Moravian
Serbia
,
aware
of
the
Ottoman
threat
,
began
diplomatic
and
military
preparations
for
a
campaign
against
the
Ottomans
.

After
the
defeat
of
the
Ottomans
at
Pločnik
-LRB-
1386
-RRB-
and
Bileća
-LRB-
1388
-RRB-
,
Murad
I
,
the
reigning
Ottoman
sultan
,
moved
his
troops
from
Philippoupolis
-LRB-
Plovdiv
in
modern
Bulgaria
-RRB-
in
the
spring
of
1389
to
Ihtiman
.

From
there
,
the
party
traveled
across
Velbužd
-LRB-
Kyustendil
-RRB-
and
Kratovo
-LRB-
present-day
Macedonia
-RRB-
.

Though
longer
than
the
alternative
route
through
Sofia
and
the
Nišava
Valley
,
this
route
led
the
Ottoman
party
to
Kosovo
,
one
of
the
most
important
crossroads
in
the
Balkans
.

From
Kosovo
,
Murad
's
party
could
attack
the
lands
of
either
Lazar
of
Serbia
or
Vuk
Branković
.

Having
stayed
in
Kratovo
for
a
time
,
Murad
and
his
troops
marched
through
Kumanovo
,
Preševo
and
Gnjilane
to
Pristina
,
where
he
arrived
on
June
14
.

While
there
is
less
information
about
Lazar
's
preparations
,
he
gathered
his
troops
near
Niš
,
on
the
right
bank
of
the
South
Morava
River
.

His
party
likely
remained
there
until
he
learned
that
Murad
had
moved
to
Velbužd
,
whereupon
he
moved
across
Prokuplje
to
Kosovo
.

This
was
the
best
place
Lazar
could
choose
as
a
battlefield
,
as
it
gave
him
control
of
all
the
routes
that
Murad
could
take
.

Murad
's
army
numbered
from
27,000
to
40,000
fighters
.

These
40,000
included
no
more
than
2,000
Janissaries
,
2,500
of
Murad
's
cavalry
guard
,
6,000
sipahis
,
20,000
azaps
and
akincis
,
and
8,000
troops
from
his
vassals
.

Marko
and
Dragaš
,
although
Ottoman
vassals
,
did
not
participate
in
the
battle
.

Lazar
's
army
numbered
from
12,000
to
30,000
.

Out
of
approximately
30,000
fighters
present
,
12,000
to
15,000
were
under
Lazar
's
command
,
with
5,000
to
10,000
under
Vuk
Branković
,
a
Serbian
nobleman
from
Kosovo
,
and
just
as
many
under
nobleman
Vlatko
Vuković
.

The
latter
troops
were
sent
by
Bosnian
king
Tvrtko
I
Kotromanic
.

Mixed
with
Vuković
's
army
was
a
contingent
of
Knights
Hospitallers
,
whom
the
Croatian
knight
John
of
Palisna
had
led
from
Vrana
in
Croatia
.

Several
thousand
were
cavalry
.

Furthermore
,
there
has
been
several
accounts
which
have
mentioned
that
the
``
Christian
army
''
of
Lazar
was
far
greater
,
and
that
it
also
included
contingents
of
other
nations
,
although
these
can
not
be
verified
.

The
armies
met
at
Kosovo
Field
.

Murad
headed
the
Ottoman
army
,
with
his
sons
Bayezid
on
his
right
and
Yakub
on
his
left
.

Around
1,000
archers
were
in
the
front
line
in
the
wings
,
backed
up
by
azap
and
akinci
;
in
the
front
center
were
janissaries
,
behind
whom
was
Murad
,
surrounded
by
his
cavalry
guard
;
finally
,
the
supply
train
at
the
rear
was
guarded
by
a
small
number
of
troops
.

The
Serbian
army
had
Prince
Lazar
at
its
center
,
Vuk
on
the
right
and
Vlatko
on
the
left
.

At
the
front
of
the
Serbian
army
were
the
heavy
cavalry
and
archer
cavalry
on
the
flanks
,
with
the
infantry
to
the
rear
.

While
parallel
,
the
dispositions
of
the
armies
were
not
symmetrical
,
as
the
Serbian
center
had
a
broader
front
than
the
Ottoman
center
.

Serbian
and
Turkish
accounts
of
the
battle
differ
,
making
it
difficult
to
reconstruct
the
course
of
events
.

It
is
believed
that
the
battle
commenced
with
Ottoman
archers
shooting
at
Serbian
cavalry
,
who
then
made
for
the
attack
.

After
positioning
in
a
V-shaped
formation
,
the
Serbian
cavalry
managed
to
break
through
the
Ottoman
left
wing
,
but
were
not
as
successful
against
the
center
and
the
right
wing
.

The
Serbs
had
the
initial
advantage
after
their
first
charge
,
which
significantly
damaged
the
Turkish
wing
commanded
by
Yakub
Celebi
.

When
the
knights
'
charge
was
finished
,
light
Ottoman
cavalry
and
light
infantry
counter-attacked
and
the
Serbian
heavy
armour
became
a
disadvantage
.

In
the
center
,
Serbian
fighters
managed
to
push
back
Ottoman
forces
,
except
for
Bayezid
's
wing
,
which
barely
held
off
the
forces
commanded
by
Vlatko
Vuković
.

Vuković
thus
inflicted
disproportionately
heavy
losses
on
the
Turks
.

The
Ottomans
,
in
a
ferocious
counter-attack
led
by
Bayezid
,
pushed
the
Serbian
forces
back
and
then
prevailed
later
in
the
day
,
routing
the
Serbian
infantry
.

Both
flanks
still
held
,
with
Vuković
's
drifting
toward
the
center
to
compensate
for
the
heavy
losses
inflicted
on
the
Serbian
infantry
.

Historic
facts
say
that
Vuk
Branković
had
seen
that
there
was
no
hope
for
victory
,
and
fled
to
save
as
many
men
as
he
could
.

He
fled
after
Lazar
was
captured
,
but
in
songs
,
it
is
said
that
he
betrayed
Lazar
,
and
left
him
to
death
in
middle
of
battle
rather
than
after
Lazar
was
captured
and
the
center
massacred
.

Bayezid
gained
his
nickname
``
the
Thunderbolt
''
here
,
after
leading
the
decisive
counter-attack
.

Sometime
after
Branković
's
retreat
from
the
battle
,
the
remaining
Bosnian
and
Serb
forces
yielded
the
field
,
believing
that
a
victory
was
no
longer
possible
.

As
the
battle
turned
against
the
Serbs
,
one
of
their
noblemen
,
a
knight
named
Miloš
Obilić
,
pretended
to
desert
to
the
Turkish
forces
.

When
he
was
brought
before
Murad
,
Obilić
pulled
out
a
hidden
dagger
and
killed
the
Sultan
by
slashing
him
from
belly
to
neck
.

The
Sultan
's
bodyguards
immediately
hacked
Miloš
Obilić
to
pieces
.

The
earliest
preserved
record
,
a
letter
from
the
Florentine
senate
to
King
Tvrtko
I
of
Bosnia
dated
20
October
1389
,
says
that
Murad
was
killed
during
the
battle
.

Murad
's
son
,
Bayezid
,
was
informed
of
the
sultan
's
death
before
his
older
brother
Yakub
.

Bayezid
sent
Yakub
a
false
message
,
stating
that
their
father
had
some
new
orders
for
them
.

When
Yakub
arrived
,
he
was
strangled
to
death
,
leaving
Bayezid
as
the
sole
heir
to
the
Ottoman
throne
.

The
bulk
of
both
armies
were
wiped
out
in
the
battle
;
both
Lazar
and
Murad
lost
their
lives
,
and
the
remnants
of
their
armies
eventually
retreated
from
the
battlefield
.

The
Serbs
were
left
with
too
few
men
to
defend
their
lands
effectively
,
while
the
Turks
had
many
more
troops
in
the
east
.

Consequently
,
the
Serbian
principalities
that
were
not
already
Ottoman
vassals
,
one
after
the
other
became
so
in
the
following
years
.

Furthermore
,
in
response
to
Turkish
pressure
,
some
Serbian
noblemen
wed
their
daughters
,
including
the
daughter
of
Prince
Lazar
,
to
Bayezid
.

In
the
wake
of
these
marriages
,
Stefan
Lazarević
became
a
loyal
ally
of
Bayezid
,
going
on
to
contribute
significant
forces
to
many
of
Bayezid
's
future
military
engagements
,
including
the
Battle
of
Nicopolis
.

Eventually
,
the
Serbian
Despotate
would
,
on
numerous
occasions
,
attempt
to
defeat
the
Ottomans
in
conjunction
with
the
Hungarians
until
its
final
defeat
in
1459
and
again
in
1540
.

The
Battle
of
Kosovo
came
to
be
seen
as
a
symbol
of
Serbian
patriotism
and
desire
for
independence
in
the
19th
century
rise
of
nationalism
under
Ottoman
rule
,
including
the
Kosovo
curse
,
and
its
significance
for
Serbian
nationalism
returned
to
prominence
during
the
breakup
of
Yugoslavia
and
the
Kosovo
War
when
Slobodan
Milošević
invoked
it
during
an
important
speech
.

The
battle
was
also
a
major
blow
to
the
Ottoman
campaign
,
and
although
the
Ottomans
did
eventually
take
over
most
of
the
Balkans
,
it
took
them
over
a
hundred
years
to
do
so
.

After
the
destruction
of
their
forces
at
Kosovo
,
the
Ottomans
were
forced
to
send
inexperienced
reserve
armies
to
Europe
.

This
problem
was
partly
solved
with
the
``
recruitment
''
of
Jannisaries
from
the
Balkans
.

The
delay
in
Ottoman
advancement
also
effectively
stopped
the
Ottomans
from
invading
central
and
west
Europe
,
as
it
gave
time
to
central
European
nations
to
fortify
and
mount
proper
defenses
.
