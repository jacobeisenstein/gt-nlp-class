Method
of
Fluxions
is
a
book
by
Isaac
Newton
.

The
book
was
completed
in
1671
,
and
published
in
1736
.

Fluxions
is
Newton
's
term
for
differential
calculus
-LRB-
fluents
was
his
term
for
integral
calculus
-RRB-
.

He
originally
developed
the
method
at
Woolsthorpe
Manor
during
the
closing
of
Cambridge
during
the
Great
Plague
of
London
from
1665
to
1667
,
but
did
not
choose
to
make
his
findings
known
-LRB-
similarly
,
his
findings
which
eventually
became
the
Philosophiae
Naturalis
Principia
Mathematica
were
developed
at
this
time
and
hidden
from
the
world
in
Newton
's
notes
for
many
years
-RRB-
.

Gottfried
Leibniz
developed
his
calculus
around
1673
,
and
published
it
in
1684
,
fifty
years
before
Newton
.

The
calculus
notation
we
use
today
is
mostly
that
of
Leibniz
,
although
Newton
's
dot
notation
for
differentiation
for
denoting
derivatives
with
respect
to
time
is
still
in
current
use
throughout
mechanics
and
circuit
analysis
.

Newton
's
Method
of
Fluxions
was
formally
published
posthumously
,
but
following
Leibniz
's
publication
of
the
calculus
a
bitter
rivalry
erupted
between
the
two
mathematicians
over
who
had
developed
the
calculus
first
and
so
Newton
no
longer
hid
his
knowledge
of
fluxions
.
