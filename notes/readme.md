These notes are the basis for the readings in CS4650 and CS7650 ("Natural Language") at Georgia Tech.

You are welcome to use these notes and slides for your own learning or teaching, assuming you give attribution. If you do use this material in your class, please tell me! This will help me justify the time that I have spent on them. 

Feedback of any kind is also welcome. You can reach me directly at jacobe gatech edu.

There are two PDFs for the notes:

- [eisenstein-nlp-notes-snapshot.pdf](eisenstein-nlp-notes-snapshot.pdf) is the latest version, including up-to-the-minute edits and corrections.
- [eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf](eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf) is a more "stable" version, which is necessary because I am teaching from these notes right now (Spring semester 2017). I will try to update this version no more than once per week, before monday morning. However, if I find a serious error, I may update immediately.
