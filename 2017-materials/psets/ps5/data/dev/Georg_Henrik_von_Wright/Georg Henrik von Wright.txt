-RRB-
was
a
Finnish
philosopher
,
who
succeeded
Ludwig
Wittgenstein
as
professor
at
the
University
of
Cambridge
.

He
published
in
English
,
Finnish
,
German
,
and
in
Swedish
.

Belonging
to
the
Swedish-speaking
minority
of
Finland
,
von
Wright
also
had
Finnish
and
17th-century
Scottish
ancestors
.

Von
Wright
's
writings
come
under
two
broad
categories
.

The
first
is
analytic
philosophy
and
philosophical
logic
in
the
Anglo-American
vein
.

His
1951
books
,
An
Essay
in
Modal
Logic
and
Deontic
Logic
,
were
landmarks
in
the
postwar
rise
of
formal
modal
logic
and
its
deontic
version
.

He
was
an
authority
on
Wittgenstein
,
editing
his
later
works
.

He
was
the
leading
figure
in
the
Finnish
philosophy
of
his
time
,
specializing
in
philosophical
logic
,
philosophical
analysis
,
philosophy
of
action
,
philosophy
of
language
,
philosophy
of
mind
,
and
the
close
study
of
Charles
Sanders
Peirce
.

The
other
vein
in
von
Wright
's
writings
is
moralist
and
pessimist
.

During
the
last
twenty
years
of
his
life
,
under
the
influence
of
Oswald
Spengler
,
Jürgen
Habermas
and
the
Frankfurt
school
's
reflections
about
modern
Rationality
,
he
wrote
prolifically
.

His
best
known
article
from
this
period
is
entitled
The
Myth
of
Progress
,
and
it
questions
whether
our
apparent
material
and
technological
progress
can
really
be
considered
``
progress
''
.

In
the
last
year
of
his
life
,
among
his
other
honorary
degrees
,
he
held
an
honorary
degree
at
the
University
of
Bergen
.
