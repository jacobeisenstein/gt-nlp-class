Camperdown
and
Darlington
on

through
which
it
offers
bachelor
's
degrees
,
master
's

.

Three
Nobel

have
been
affiliated
with
the

.

Sydney
consistently
ranks
amongst
the
top
universities
in
Australia
,
Oceania
and
the
world
.

In

,
it
was

The
University
of
Sydney
is
a
member
of
Australia
's
Group
of
Eight
,
Academic
Consortium
21
,
the
Association
of
Pacific
Rim
Universities
-LRB-
APRU
-RRB-
and
the
Worldwide
Universities
Network
.

The
university
is
also
colloquially
known
as
one
of
Australia
's
sandstone
universities
.

In
1848
,
in
the
New
South
Wales
Legislative
Council
,
William
Wentworth
proposed
a
plan
to
expand
the
existing
Sydney
College
into
a
larger
university
.

Wentworth
argued
that
a
state
university
was
imperative
for
the
growth
of
a
society
aspiring
towards
self-government
,
and
that
it
would
provide
the
opportunity
for
``
the
child
of
every
class
,
to
become
great
and
useful
in
the
destinies
of
his
country
''
.

It
would
take
two
attempts
on
Wentworth
's
behalf
,
however
,
before
the
plan
was
finally
adopted
.

The
university
was
established
via
the
passage
of
the
University
of
Sydney
Act
,
on
24
September
1850
and
was
assented
on
1
October
1850
by
Sir
Charles
Fitzroy
.

Two
years
later
,
the
university
was
inaugurated
on
11
October
1852
in
the
Big
Schoolroom
of
what
is
now
Sydney
Grammar
School
.

The
first
principal
was
John
Woolley
.

On
27
February
1858
the
university
received
its
Royal
Charter
from
Queen
Victoria
,
giving
degrees
conferred
by
the
university
rank
and
recognition
equal
to
those
given
by
universities
in
the
United
Kingdom
.

By
1859
,
the
university
had
moved
to
its
current
site
in
the
Sydney
suburb
of
Camperdown
.

In
1858
,
the
passage
of
the
Electoral
Act
provided
for
the
university
to
become
a
constituency
for
the
New
South
Wales
Legislative
Assembly
as
soon
as
there
were
100
graduates
with
higher
degrees
.

This
seat
in
the
Parliament
of
New
South
Wales
was
first
filled
in
1876
,
but
was
abolished
in
1880
one
year
after
its
second
member
,
Edmund
Barton
,
was
elected
to
the
Legislative
Assembly
.

Most
of
the
estate
of
John
Henry
Challis
was
bequeathed
to
the
university
,
which
received
a
sum
of
#
200,000
in
1889
.

This
was
thanks
in
part
due
to
William
Montagu
Manning
-LRB-
Chancellor
1878
--
1895
-RRB-
who
argued
against
the
claims
by
British
Tax
Commissioners
.

The
following
year
seven
professorships
were
created
:
anatomy
;
zoology
;
engineering
;
history
;
law
;
logic
and
mental
philosophy
;
and
modern
literature
.

The
New
England
University
College
was
founded
as
part
of
the
University
of
Sydney
in
1938
and
later
separated
in
1954
to
become
the
University
of
New
England
.

During
the
late
1960s
,
the
University
of
Sydney
was
at
the
centre
of
rows
to
introduce
courses
on
Marxism
and
feminism
at
the
major
Australian
universities
.

At
one
stage
,
newspaper
reporters
descended
on
the
University
to
cover
brawls
,
demonstrations
,
secret
memos
and
a
walk-out
by
Professor
David
Armstrong
,
a
respected
philosopher
who
held
the
Challis
Chair
of
Philosophy
from
1959
to
1991
,
after
students
at
one
of
his
lectures
openly
demanded
a
course
on
feminism
.

The
philosophy
department
split
over
the
issue
to
become
the
Traditional
and
Modern
Philosophy
Department
,
headed
by
Armstrong
and
following
a
more
traditional
approach
to
philosophy
,
and
the
General
Philosophy
Department
,
which
follows
the
French
continental
approach
.

Prior
to
1981
,
the
Sydney
Institute
of
Education
was
the
Sydney
Teachers
College
.

The
Orange
Agricultural
College
-LRB-
OAC
-RRB-
was
originally
transferred
to
the
University
of
New
England
under
the
Act
,
but
then
transferred
to
the
University
of
Sydney
in
1994
,
as
part
of
the
reforms
to
the
University
of
New
England
undertaken
by
the
University
of
New
England
Act
1993
and
the
Southern
Cross
University
Act
1993
.

In
January
2005
,
the
University
of
Sydney
transferred
the
OAC
to
Charles
Sturt
University
.

In
2001
,
the
University
of
Sydney
chancellor
,
Dame
Leonie
Kramer
,
was
forced
to
resign
by
the
university
's
governing
body
.

In
2003
,
Nick
Greiner
,
a
former
Premier
of
New
South
Wales
,
resigned
from
his
position
as
chair
of
the
university
's
Graduate
School
of
Management
because
of
academic
protests
against
his
simultaneous
chairmanship
of
British
American
Tobacco
-LRB-
Australia
-RRB-
.

Subsequently
,
his
wife
,
Kathryn
Greiner
,
resigned
in
protest
from
the
two
positions
she
held
at
the
university
as
chair
of
the
Sydney
Peace
Foundation
and
a
member
of
the
executive
council
of
the
Research
Institute
for
Asia
and
the
Pacific
.

In
2005
,
the
Public
Service
Association
of
New
South
Wales
and
the
Community
and
Public
Sector
Union
were
in
dispute
with
the
university
over
a
proposal
to
privatise
security
at
the
main
campus
-LRB-
and
the
Cumberland
campus
-RRB-
.

In
February
2007
,
the
university
agreed
to
acquire
a
portion
of
the
land
granted
to
St
John
's
College
to
develop
the
Sydney
Institute
of
Health
and
Medical
Research
.

As
a
Roman
Catholic
institution
,
in
handing
over
the
land
St
John
's
placed
limitations
on
the
type
of
medical
research
which
could
be
conducted
on
the
premises
,
seeking
to
preserve
the
essence
of
the
college
's
mission
.

This
caused
concern
among
some
groups
,
who
argued
that
it
would
interfere
with
scientific
medical
research
.

However
,
this
was
rejected
by
the
university
's
administration
because
the
building
was
not
intended
for
this
purpose
and
there
were
many
other
facilities
in
close
proximity
where
such
research
could
take
place
.

At
the
start
of
2010
,
the
university
controversially
adopted
a
new
logo
.

It
retains
the
same
university
arms
,
however
it
takes
on
a
more
modern
look
.

There
have
been
stylistic
changes
,
the
main
one
being
the
coat
of
arm
's
mantling
,
the
shape
of
the
escutcheon
-LRB-
shield
-RRB-
,
the
removal
of
the
motto
scroll
,
and
also
others
more
subtle
within
the
arms
itself
,
such
as
the
mane
and
fur
of
the
lion
,
the
number
of
lines
in
the
open
book
and
the
colouration
.

The
original
Coat
of
Arms
from
1857
continues
to
be
used
for
ceremonial
and
other
formal
purposes
,
such
as
on
testamurs
.

The
Grant
of
Arms
was
made
by
the
College
of
Arms
in
1857
.

Argent
on
a
Cross
Azure
and
open
book
proper
,
clasps
Gold
,
between
four
Stars
of
eight
points
Or
,
on
a
chief
Gules
a
Lion
passant
Guardant
also
Or
,
together
with
this
motto
``
Sidere
mens
eadem
mutato
''
to
be
borne
and
used
forever
herafter
by
the
said
University
of
Sydney
on
their
Common
Seal
,
Shields
or
otherwise
according
to
the
Law
of
Arms
.

The
use
of
eight-pointed
stars
was
unusual
for
arms
at
the
time
,
although
they
had
been
used
unofficially
as
emblems
for
New
South
Wales
since
the
1820s
and
on
the
arms
of
the
Church
of
England
Diocese
of
Australia
in
1836
.

According
to
the
university
,
the
Latin
motto
Sidere
mens
eadem
mutato
can
be
translated
as
``
Though
the
constellations
change
,
the
mind
is
universal
''
,
thereby
,
conveying
the
aspiration
that
``
the
traditions
of
the
older
universities
of
the
Northern
Hemisphere
are
continued
here
in
the
Southern
''
.

Author
and
university
alumnus
Clive
James
quipped
in
his
1981
autobiography
that
the
motto
loosely
translates
as
``
Sydney
University
is
really
Oxford
or
Cambridge
laterally
displaced
approximately
12,000
miles
''
.

The

.

The
University
of
Sydney
currently
has
financial
endowments
totalling
$
829
million
.

A
drop
due
to
recent
downturn
of
the
global
economic
situation
.

The
university
's
turnover
,
in
turn
,
was
A$
1.3
billion
in
2008
.

Latest
figures
show
that
the
University
of
Sydney
has
received
the
highest
amount
of
research
grants
,
which
may
demonstrate
its
research
competitiveness
and
the
size
of
its
students
and
staff
body
.

The
University
of
Sydney
also
has
the
second
largest
-LRB-
behind
Monash
University
-RRB-
body
of
students
and
researchers
among
Australian
universities
.

The
University
of
Sydney
secured
more
than
$
46
million
in
funding
in
the
2007
round
of
National
Health
and
Medical
Research
Council
-LRB-
NHMRC
-RRB-
Project
Grant
,
Capacity

.

The
James
Jones
foundation
has
announced
the
2007
recipient
of
the
bicentennial
award
in
university
research
linked
to
applied
agricultural
economics
.

The
award
includes
various
grant
and
research
opportunities
that
may
be
taken
up
by
both
staff
members
and
senior
students
.

Five
of
the
university
's
affiliated
medical
research
facilities
secured
$
38
million
in
the
Australian
government
's
2006
budget
,
part
of
$
163
million
made
available
for
a
variety
of
development
and
expansion
projects
.

The
main
campus
is
spread
across
two
inner-city
suburbs
of
Sydney
:
Camperdown
and
Darlington
.

Originally
housed
in
what
is
now
Sydney
Grammar
School
,
in
1855
the
government
granted
the
university
land
in
Grose
Farm
,
three
kilometres
from
the
city
,
which
is
now
the
main
Camperdown
campus
.

The
architect
Edmund
Blacket
designed
the
original
Neogothic
sandstone
Quadrangle
and
Great
Tower
buildings
,
which
were
completed
in
1862
.

The
rapid
expansion
of
the
university
in
the
mid-20th
century
resulted
in
the
acquisition
of
land
in
Darlington
across
City
Road
.

The
Camperdown/Darlington
campus
houses
the
university
's
administrative
headquarters
,
and
the
Faculties
of
Arts
,
Science
,
Education
and
Social
Work
,
Pharmacy
,
Veterinary
Science
,
Economics
and
Business
,
Architecture
,
and
Engineering
.

It
is
also
the
home
base
of
the
large
Faculty
of
Medicine
,
which
has
numerous
affiliated
teaching
hospitals
across
the
state
.

The
main
campus
is
also
the
focus
of
the
university
's
student
life
,
with
the
student-run
University
of
Sydney
Union
-LRB-
known
as
`
the
Union
'
-RRB-
in
possession
of
three
buildings
--
Wentworth
,
Manning
and
Holme
Buildings
.

These
buildings
house
a
large
proportion
of
the
university
's
catering
outlets
,
and
provide
space
for
recreational
rooms
,
bars
and
function
centres
.

One
of
the
largest
activities
organised
by
the
Union
is
the
Orientation
Week
-LRB-
or
`
O-week
'
-RRB-
,
centring
on
stalls
set
up
by
clubs
and
societies
on
the
Front
Lawns
.

The
university
is
currently
undertaking
a
large
capital
works
program
with
the
aim
of
revitalising
the
campus
and
providing
more
office
,
teaching
and
student
space
.

The
program
will
see
the
amalgamation
of
the
smaller
science
and
technical
libraries
into
a
larger
library
,
and
the
construction
of
a
central
administration
and
student
services
building
along
City
Road
.

A
new
building
for
the
School
of
Information
Technologies
opened
in
late
2006
and
has
been
located
on
a
site
adjacent
to
the
Seymour
Centre
.

The
busy
Eastern
Avenue
thoroughfare
has
been
transformed
into
a
pedestrian
plaza
and
a
new
footbridge
has
been
built
over
City
Road
.

The
new
home
for
the
Sydney
Law
School
,
located
alongside
Fisher
Library
on
the
site
of
the
old
Edgeworth
David
and
Stephen
Roberts
buildings
,
has
been
completed
.

From
2007
,
the
university
has
used
space
in
the
former
Eveleigh
railway
yards
,
just
to
the
south
of
Darlington
,
for
examination
purposes
.

The
campus
is
well
served
by
public
transport
,
being
a
short
walk
from
Redfern
railway
station
and
served
by
buses
on
the
neighbouring
Parramatta
Road
and
City
Road
.

The
University
of
Sydney
Library
consists
of
eleven
individual
libraries
located
across
the
University
's
various
campuses
.

According
to
the
library
's
publications
,
it
is
the
largest
academic
library
in
the
southern
hemisphere
;
university
statistics
show
that
in
2007
the
collection
consisted
of
just
under
5
million
physical
volumes
and
a
further
300,000
e-books
,
for
a
total
of
approximately
5.3
million
items
.

The
Rare
Books
Library
possesses
several
extremely
rare
items
,
including
one
of
the
two
extant
copies
of
the
Gospel
of
Barnabas
and
a
first
edition
of
Isaac
Newton
's
Philosophiae
Naturalis
Principia
Mathematica
.

The
University
has
a
number
of
residential
college
and
halls
of
residence
,
based
on
the
college
system
of
Cambridge
and
Oxford
universities
,
each
with
its
own
distinctive
style
and
facilities
.

All
offer
tutorial
support
and
a
wide
range
of
social
and
sporting
activities
in
a
supportive
communal
environment
.

Five
colleges
are
affiliated
with
religious
denominations
and
while
this
gives
each
of
these
colleges
a
special
character
,
students
of
any
denomination
or
religion
are
eligible
for
admission
.

Unlike
some
residential
colleges
in
British
or
American
universities
,
the
colleges
are
not
affiliated
with
any
specific
discipline
of
study
.

``
Intercol
''
refers
to
the
six
colleges
which
exist
on
campus
.

They
are
modelled
on
the
British
system
of
colleges
and
competition
for
entry
is
high
each
year
.

The
Colleges
compete
in
the
Rawson
Cup
-LRB-
sport
for
men
-RRB-
the
Rosebowl
cup
-LRB-
sport
for
women
-RRB-
and
the
Palladian
Cup
-LRB-
drama
,
debating
and
music
for
both
men
and
women
-RRB-
.

The
University
also
has
three
other
residential
systems
,
which
are
different
to
the
colleges
,
and
are
not
part
of
the
intercol
system
.

For
a
variety
of
reasons
,
the
intercol
network
has
chosen
to
have
no
affiliation
with
these
``
houses
''
.

There
is
also
a
university-affiliated
housing
cooperative
,
Stucco
.

The
SRC
and
Union
are
both
governed
by
student
representatives
,
who
are
elected
by
students
each
year
.

Elections
for
the
USU
Board
of
Directors
occur
in
first
semester
;
elections
for
the
SRC
President
,
and
for
members
of
the
Students
'
Representative
Council
itself
,
occur
in
second
semester
,
along
with
a
separate
election
for
the
editorial
board
of
the
student
newspaper
Honi
Soit
,
which
is
published
by
the
SRC
.

The
elections
are
usually
closely
contested
,
and
result
in
much
of
the
main
campus
being
covered
with
chalk
messages
from
the
various
candidates
.

However
,
some
complaints
have
been
made
in
the
pages
of
Honi
Soit
and
other
publications
about
the
organisations
'
claims
to
represent
the
student
body
,
citing
perennially
low
voter
turnouts
and
the
general
apathy
of
much
of
the
university
population
to
student
politics
.

The
future
of
these
organisations
was
believed
to
be
under
a
shadow
with
the
passage
of
legislation
implementing
voluntary
student
unionism
in
late
2005
.

The
legislation
prohibited
the
compulsory
collection
of
fees
from
students
,
which
had
been
the
customary
means
of
funding
student
organisations
,
after
the
beginning
of
Semester
2
of
2006
.

Although
the
organisations
continue
to
be
concerned
about
their
long-term
financial
viability
,
they
have
secured
significant
funding
from
the
University
to
partially
make
up
for
lost
revenue
.
