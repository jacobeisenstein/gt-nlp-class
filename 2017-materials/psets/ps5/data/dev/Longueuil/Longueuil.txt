city
in
the
province
of

,
Canada
.

It

administrative

and
the
central
city
of
the
Urban

.

It

making

Montreal
's
second

,
the
fifth
most
populous
city
in
Quebec
and
nineteenth
largest
in
Canada
.

Charles
Le
Moyne
founded
Longueuil
as
a
seigneurie
in
1657
.

It
would
become
a
parish
in
1845
,
a
village
in
1848
,
a
town
in
1874
and
a
city
in

.

Between
1961
and
2002
,
Longueuil
's
borders
grew
three
times
,
as
it
was
amalgamated
with
surrounding
municipalities
;
there
was
a
partial
de-amalgamation
in
2006
-LRB-
see
2000
--
2006
municipal
reorganization
in
Quebec
-RRB-
.

Longueuil
is
a
residential
,
commercial
and
industrial
city
.

It
incorporates
some
urban
features
,
but
is
essentially
a
suburb
.

Longueuil
can
be
classified
as
a
commuter
town
as
a
large
portion
of
its
residents
commute
to
work
in
Montreal
.

Most
buildings
are
single-family
homes
constructed
in
the
post-war
period
.

The
city
consists
of
three
boroughs
:
Le
Vieux-Longueuil
,
Saint-Hubert
and
Greenfield
Park
.

Longueuil
is
the
seat
of
the
judicial
district
of
Longueuil
.

Residents
of
the
city
are
called
Longueuillois
.

The
territory
of
New
France
was
divided
into
seigneuries
in
order
to
ensure
the
colony
's
defence
.

Longueuil
was
founded
in
1657
by
Charles
Le
Moyne
,
a
merchant
from
Ville-Marie
-LRB-
present
day
Montreal
-RRB-
,
as
a
seigneurie
.

According
to
Abbé
Faillon
,
Charles
Le
Moyne
,
lord
of
the
area
starting
in
1657
,
named
Longueuil
after
a
village
which
is
today
the
seat
of
a
canton
in
the
district
of
Dieppe
in
his
homeland
of
Normandy
.

In
France
,
the
name
is
spelled
``
Longueil
''
and
it
is
rumored
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
spell
it
``
Longueuil
''
.

His
son
,
Charles
Le
Moyne
de
Longueuil
,
built
Fort
Longueuil
as
his
fortified
residence
.

It
was
constructed
of
stone
between
1685
and
1690
and
had
four
towers
.

Fort
Longueuil
was
believed
to
be
occupied
by
American
troops
during
the
American
Revolutionary
War
.

It
was
subsequently
occupied
by
the
British
.

It
was
demolished
in
1810
due
to
its
poor
condition
.

The
archaeological
remains
of
Fort
Longueuil
were
recognized
as
a
National
Historic
Site
of
Canada
on
May
25
,
1923
.

The
site
extends
beneath
the
present-day
Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue
Cathedral
.

The
seigneurial
system
ended
in
1845
and
Longueuil
was
turned
into
a
parish
municipality
named
Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil
.

In
1848
,
a
portion
detached
from
the
parish
and
officially
established
as
the
village
of
Longueuil
.

This
same
village
became
a
town
in
1874
,
and
then
a
city
in
1920
.

Musician
Paul
Pratt
notably
served
as
the
city
's
mayor
from
1935-1966
.

Longueuil
's
city
limits
expanded
for
the
first
time
in
1961
when
it
merged
with
Montréal-Sud
,
and
again
in
1969
when
it
merged
with
Ville
Jacques-Cartier
.

In
both
cases
,
Longueuil
was
chosen
as
the
name
of
the
new
city
.

On
January
1
,
2002
,
as
part
of
the
2000
--
2006
municipal
reorganization
in
Quebec
,
the
provincial
government
amalgamated
the
former
Longueuil
with
Boucherville
,
Brossard
,
Greenfield
Park
,
LeMoyne
,
Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville
,
Saint-Hubert
and
Saint-Lambert
.

As
with
the
1960s
,
the
name
Longueuil
was
chosen
for
the
new
city
.

However
,
after
a
change
of
government
and
a
2004
referendum
,
Boucherville
,
Brossard
,
Saint-Lambert
and
Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville
were
re-constituted
as
independent
cities

1
