Language models
---------------

Do all exercises in parts 1-4 in Ken Church's [Unix for Poets](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/readings/UnixforPoets.pdf?raw=true), using
a (long) text of your choosing. Your homework should include the command lines you run for the exercises where he doesn't provide the solution. (This homework may take a little longer than others, but should be under an hour.)

- A good place to get texts is [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).
- In the examples, "tail +2" is used. This doesn't work on my linux distribution, but "tail -n +2" does.
- You may also find "less" more useful than "sed 5q".
